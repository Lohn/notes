Lifehacks are all those "one weird trick" things to affect change in life.

Seems like they were really popular in the 2000s and I internalized them as cleverness.

These days, I mainly use the term sarcastically. I have often experienced them as false silver bullets and novel toys that end up not really solving anything for me, in the end.
