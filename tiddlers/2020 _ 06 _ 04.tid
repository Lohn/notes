* Black Lives Matter
* No person steps twice in the same river
** There do exist standing waves, though
* Crap. The SR button in my right joy con stopped working last night. Going to need to open it up again and rework the solder - guessing the joints were slight enough to physically break.
* Trying to think of a term that's like "[[dreamcatcher|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcatcher]]" except for awake thoughts
** Maybe that's [[ZettelKasten]]?
** Also that's an appropriative and clumsy thought.
** And the notes aren't harmful things trapped.
*** Though it is a relief to have them captured outside my head.
** Maybe [[baleen|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleen]] for filter feeding is better?
* Thinking about fixing my AboutMePage again
* There are things in TiddlyWiki that feel itchy to me. Maybe someday I'll scratch the itch. I'm feeling like [[Dread Pirate Roberts]] about it. This seems to be A Thing with me
* Thinking about [[whether side projects are good and healthy]]
* Thinking about [[age and my career future]]
* Thinking about if / when / [[how things I compose here become blog posts]]
* Thinking about how [[I'd like to produce more]]
* Thinking about how [[twitter ate my brain]]
* I don't always agree with him, but I have long admired how [[Dave Winer]] lives on the web.
* There are days I miss making mopey posts on LiveJournal. Maybe things better kept to myself, but I got something out of it and the occasional comments I'd get.
* Thinking about learning more about [[Beaker Browser]]
* [[Rob Hubbard - "Skate or Die (C64) - Intro"|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-50h7SMI_Tg]] makes me want to do some [[Streaming]] again if only to listen to some chiptunes
* Feel like I should learn a bit more about [[Deno]]
* Reading [[Rediscovering the Small Web|https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/]]
** This kind of makes me want to add a guestbook to my AboutMePage
