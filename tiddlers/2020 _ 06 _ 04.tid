* Good morning
* No person steps twice in the same river
** There do exist standing waves, though
* Trying to think of a term that's like "[[dreamcatcher|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcatcher]]" except for awake thoughts
** Maybe that's [[ZettelKasten]]?
** Also that's an appropriative and clumsy thought.
** And the notes aren't harmful things trapped.
*** Though it is a relief to have them captured outside my head.
** Maybe [[baleen|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleen]] for filter feeding is better?
* Thinking about fixing my AboutMePage again
* There are things in TiddlyWiki that feel itchy to me. Maybe someday I'll scratch the itch. I'm feeling like [[Dread Pirate Roberts]] about it. This seems to be A Thing with me
