Life's too short to be too serious. Also, I probably suffer from [[high functioning anxiety]] and [[depression]]. I like to compensate for that with silly bullshit. [[I should see a therapist]]

People seem to be amused and made happy by whimsy. I like being amused and happy and being around people who are the same.
