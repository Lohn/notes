* Streamed last night. It was neat.
* Should I buy [[Huntdown|https://github.com/ratwithacompiler/OBS-captions-plugin]] for [[Nintendo Switch]]?
* I should check out [[Federated Wiki]]
* Still thinking about Twitch analytics / research and StreamSchedule
* Also, on my mind again is StaticPublishing of these notes and maybe whitelisting via "public" tag
* Frustrated and thinking today about [[high functioning anxiety]], [[social anxiety]], and [[difficulty in verbal comprehension]]
* Thinking about [[a load-bearing wall in my psychology]]
* Ported my twitch chat connector over to [[NodeCG]], maybe should roll webhooks and auth and pubsub all into the same bundle to share related code
