I am often guilty of imagining or misremembering a past personal era as better than now.

Maybe I'm under the impression that I was more productive or more creative. Or that I was generally better off.

I'm not sure this is usually true. So, I like to mindfully remind myself that this is A Thing and worth watching out for as a fallacy.
