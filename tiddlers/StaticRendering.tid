* I think I'd like to produce a static rendering of this wiki and publish it to my web site.

* Would it be interesting to whitelist or blacklist published pages by tag?

* Might be neat to have a "now" page listing things I'm up to right now
** That, or have a big panel added to my AboutMePage


Template could use some work, but this seems to be a promising command line:

```
 tiddlywiki --rendertiddlers [!is[system]] $:/core/templates/static.tiddler.html static text/plain --rendertiddler $:/core/templates/static.template.css static/static.css text/plain
```
