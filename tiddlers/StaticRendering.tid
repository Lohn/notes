type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

I think I'd like to produce a static rendering of this wiki and publish it to my web site.

!! To Do

* Add a last-modified date to the static pages
* Would it be interesting to whitelist or blacklist published pages by tag?
* Might be neat to have a "now" page listing things I'm up to right now. That, and / or have a big panel added to my AboutMePage
* An RSS feed of RecentChanges could be nice
