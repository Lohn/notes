I think I'd like to produce a static rendering of this wiki and publish it to my web site.

!! To Do

* Refine the static template to include some station ID and link back to home page and my AboutMePage
* Refine the stylesheet a bit
* Remove any toolbar buttons from the title area!
* Would it be interesting to whitelist or blacklist published pages by tag?
* Might be neat to have a "now" page listing things I'm up to right now. That, and / or have a big panel added to my AboutMePage
