While [[Streaming]], there are some things that I'd like to automate. Reactions to Twitch events. Toys for me & chat to play with. Maybe auto-announce when I stream on social media.

There are some tools I'm using to work on this:

* [[CaffeinaBot]]
* [[NodeCG]]

Some integrations I'd like to pull in:

* [[ChipMachine]]
* [[Discord]]
