Dang, I had a lot of notes yesterday.

Thinking about StickerBook some more.

Sad that [[I broke my joycon on stream last night|http://192.168.0.13:9900/#2020%20%2F%2005%20%2F%2020%20-%20stream%20notes]], hopefully will fix this weekend. I think I had an expectation that I should present only successes on stream, but that's in conflict with [[Work with the garage door up]] which will show the process for good or bad.

* You know, despite breaking that part in the joycon, I'm super-impressed at how reparable the thing is overall https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Nintendo+Switch+Teardown/78263

Maybe I could convert the upstairs in my [[Animal Crossing]] house into a presentation space for streaming talks? Carve out a space on the wall to "project" slides in [[OBS]]

Long meeting day today. Feel like I had some thoughts that I missed spewing here. Trying to recover them now. Don't think that's practical. 

I got a tiny [[static site generator|bake, don't fry]] thing merged in a pull request at work [[for publishing Storybook builds|https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/blob/master/_scripts/build-storybooks-indexes.js]]. I should write some more about that and maybe blog it.

Took an hour nap today. I never do that. It felt pretty nice. I got stuff done after it.

As I mentioned on [[2020 / 05 / 19]], I wanted to move [[typing.lmorchard.com]] back to a plain static S3 bucket. I just did that. It was way easier than I remembered. So, that's done now.

So, having thought about that static site generator earlier and how simple it was, I decided to try tinkering with a new script for my blog. I called it [[Ready Blog Oven]].
