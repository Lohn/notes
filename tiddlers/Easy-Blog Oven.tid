It's not much, yet. Hopefully it won't ever be much and just stay simple and quick and build my blog easily. The name so far is a play on [[bake, don't fry]].

My last stab at a blog generator was a learning project for [[gulp]]. https://blog.lmorchard.com/2014/10/20/static-blog-generation-with-gulp/

I don't use [[gulp]] any more. So, this time, I wanted to see how naively simple I could build my blog in modern JavaScript. So far, so good: It's very simple promise based code and runs in like 4 seconds for 1000+ entries!

I have also just realized that I thought the kid's toy was called a "ready bake oven" when really it was called an "Easy-Bake Oven" - so, at one point, it was called "Ready Blog Oven" but now it's "Easy-Blog Oven"
