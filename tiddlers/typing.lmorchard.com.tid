I had a go at setting up WordPress again at https://typing.lmorchard.com

I thought that the Gutenberg editor would help grease my mental rails and get thoughts out. It didn't, not really. And now I have a PHP application to try to keep up and running.

Maybe I can return it to a statically-rendered site and go back to [[blog.lmorchard.com]]. Seems like I'm happier with a site that I [[bake, don't fry]].
