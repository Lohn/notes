For some of my commercial work with TiddlyWiki I use a Quill.js plugin, it works great for users who donâ€™t need to write dynamic markup like transclusions etc. But getting something like that working sensibly with wikitext is an ongoing project with a few intricacies

Yeah, i kind of want something like that for "simple" notes - i.e. a [[link]] or a WikiWord would be the most complex wikitext I'd write and the rest is bullet lists and prose

Might be interesting to pursue this for simple notes - i.e. just prose and links, no wiki macros or suchlike. Since Jeremy Ruston mentions he uses it for commercial work, I'll assume that plugin is not / will not be released as open source. So that could be an interesting project for me.
