* I should put air conditioning in this weekend
* Should check out the record player in the bedroom
* Tried to en-purple my right Switch joy con last night. 
** That is, replacing the stock grey plastic casing with [[a translucent ATOMIC PURPLE aftermarket shell|https://www.amazon.com/BASSTOP-Replacement-Controller-Electronics-Joycon-Atomic/dp/B075JDRHV3/]]
** Wanted to do it "real quick" without bothering to go live on stream.
** Broke the "R" shoulder button while opening the case. That's is a micro-switch soldered onto the motherboard. Ordered a replacement button.
** Guess I'm going to learn some light SMD soldering this weekend.
** Also have a hunch that I might have damaged the battery cable.
** Would still like to avoid ordering brand new joy cons
** Having all the bad luck with this fun project. ðŸ˜ž

* Thinking about needing to do something to feel better. Hard to do those things while [[feeling like this|depression]].
** [[Fans; High is next to Off on purpose|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ3GW7lVBWY]] - I've got this Technology Connections video in mind. Spoiler: need high starting torque to get over inertia & friction to get the motor spinning
** Trying to do enjoyable little projects seems to be my way of attempting to kick my motor over
** Sucks when that backfires.

* This is a day when I'm again considering about finally [[deleting my Twitter account]]
** I've been on there almost 14 years
** I feel like it's eaten my brain a lot of ways
** I haven't deleted my Facebook account, but I've cut down my interaction there to maybe once or twice a month to check in on family & acquaintances
** Twitter for me is an industry office cooler and random neat-person tracker.
** I also try to follow people who are not like me
** My [[social anxiety]] often leaves me with things like Twitter as some of my few "safe" social outlets
** I haven't found anything else that would replace it and I have some anxiety over that
** I recognize my Twitter experience is nowhere near universal
** Maybe it would be good for me to go away from there
** Maybe smaller communities like those in little Discord servers and on the ActivityPub fediverse would be a better place to spend time
** I could always "separate" from there and just try other things for awhile
** Worth considering folks I know & respect who get along just fine without being on Twitter
