title: psychological bad sector map
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Hard drives in computers often have a stored map of [[bad sectors|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_sector]] that are permanently, physically damaged and incapable of handling data. The computer avoids these.

I feel like I have a bad sector map of experiences & concerns in my life that I habitually avoid in order to maintain function. Maybe [[I'm reparable|I should see a therapist]] and not permanently, physically damaged and incapable - but I think it's a good analogy.

I often forget that I have a bad sector map. That is, until I find that I've strayed into bad sectors and suddenly my functionality falls apart. At these times I fear becoming [[spastic and shrill]].
