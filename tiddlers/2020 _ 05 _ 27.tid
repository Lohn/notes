* [[The failure mode of clever is asshole.|https://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/06/16/the-failure-state-of-clever/]]

* Threw some notes in a StreamPreflight list

* [[What if public speaking courses in the future evolved to involve OBS and a Stream Deck? How to set up a webcam and a decent mic?|https://twitter.com/lmorchard/status/1265720027077959680]]
** Hell, what if public speaking training included how to effectively emote with a virtual avatar?

* Thinking about improving the [[StaticRendering]] here

* Thinking about [[StickerBook]] and whether it might be a good next focus
** I have a vague notion that it could be handy at the Mozilla Virtu-All Hands, but don't want to pressure myself on this

* Thinking about [[Easy-Blog Oven]] and adding some todos

* Thinking about rewriting my [[AboutMePage]] to use simpler JS templates like [[Easy-Blog Oven]] - and then write about it

* I just finished filling another paper journal. Been meaning to review the last year's worth of entries - about 3 volumes.

* Occasionally, like today, I think I should work more on contributing to [[Firefox]]. I work at Mozilla but I mainly do webdev and cloud stuff. I barely ever work on [[Firefox]], which seems rather a core concern to my organization.

** Back about 10-12 years ago was the [[Age of the Mashup|https://mashable.com/2009/10/08/top-mashups/]]. Lots of APIs with few access limits that were fun to join together in Unix-pipe-like flows. Many of those APIs have disappeared or become severely limited since then. Or, at least, they're less fun to play with nowadays. Maybe they grew up? Some of them got productized and siloed.
