Once upon a time, I thought badges were keen and I started a project called [[Badger]]. It fizzled, for various reasons.

Thinking about it again. I'd like to maybe create a new thing with a few focused notions:

* Stickers
** Tiny pieces of collectable, shareable creative expression
** [[Whimsical|Whimsy]], not too serious
* A Sticker in an intersection of:
** Representation - an art image, animation, some text
** Collaborators - Users who created it
** Collectors - Users who have Acquired it
* The Acquisition of a sticker consists of:
** The agreement by a Collaborator that a Collector can claim a Sticker?
** If I want to get fancy, maybe an Acquisition is represented by [[a JWT assertion|https://jwt.io/]] signed by a key attached to the Sticker? This could be portable / federatable between Sticker instances.
** Not-so-fancy, an Acquisition could just be a row in a database linking Collaborator + Collector + Sticker
* Access control in Acquisition
** Why? Trying to stay not too serious. I don't *really* want to build a micro-credential system.
** But, a little exclusivity can be a fun game. Exclusive stickers could be fun - i.e. "you had to be there"
** Should be able to easily Invite a Collector to Acquire a sticker without explicit action - i.e. here's a reusable code in Slack / Riot, use it to claim the sticker.
** Should be able to make a Sticker more exclusive - i.e. ask for one with this form, you'll get it if we approve
** Should be able to issue a limited-time invite - i.e. here's a code, it will work once or it will expire in 1 day
** Discord has invite links, it's not a bad model for this I don't think
** All of this could be implemented with signing keys and a system gating access to signing on behalf of Collaborators
* Hosting / self-hosting
** [[Glitch]] has become a thing since I last thought about [[Badger]]. If I build something that's as easy to host as cloning a [[Glitch]] project, that would be super-cool.
** As a side benefit, something that's easily hosted on [[Glitch]] is probably easily hosted anywhere.
** I don't want to host the main or canonical instance of this thing. I'd like to make it easy for folks to spin up their own StickerBook for their own group.
* Federation / portability
** Would be super cool.
** Users with portable identity - personal info, avatars, signing keys, etc. Could reuse some ActivityPub / LinkedData ideas?
** Would a Sticker be better represented as a JSON file? As HTML with meta headers?
*** JSON - can do a structured JSON document with lots of LinkedData reuse
*** HTML - easily shareable on social media by URL, include OpenGraph headers & etc
*** Maybe both? HTML with JSON embedded?
** Stickers as portable units - maybe a JSON file encapsulating the Representation, Collaborators, public signing keys for Acquisitions?
** Acquisitions as portable units - maybe a JSON file that includes the Sticker along with metadata and signing to represent the agreement by a Collaborator that a Collector has acquired the sticker
* Building this thing
** Could be interesting to start with a command-line tool to create Users, Collaborators, Collectors, Stickers and Acquisitions
** Build the CLI tool around a library that can also be used in a web app
* Random musings
** Would SOLID
