!! About

I built an "about me" page based on a bunch of different APIs from my social media and whatnot.

* https://lmorchard.com/
** Where it's hosted
* https://github.com/lmorchard/about-me
** The main project for now
* https://github.com/lmorchard/gatsby-about-me
** Also started trying to rebuild using Gatsby as a learning project

!! To Do

* Rewrite this not to use webpack or react - just use tagged template literals
** Started doing this: https://github.com/lmorchard/about-me/tree/no-webpack
* Add a guestbook? How about a webring? (i'm not even kidding)
* Add [[scuttlebutt posts|https://viewer.scuttlebot.io/%25lk4up934FckHCT%2Bhb48EHcphWAEvsfClHKBWlOvF1jQ%3D.sha256.json]]?
* It breaks every month or so - fix it. Probably expired tokens
* Include Twitch clips rather than live video?
* Transclude a panel from HomePage here?
* Some other panels should probably also be transcluded from this wiki - like current work project(s)
