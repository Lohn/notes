It involves placing ourselves among others and in the world at large. Immodest people have, among other things, an inflated sense of themselves, their accomplishments, and their place in the world.
</p></blockquote><h2 class="">1. Modesty and Humility</h2><ul><li>Modesty is elusive. If you say you're modest, you're probably not. Somehow one must be unaware of it to be it? Otherwise, it's spoiled.</li></ul><h2 class="">1.1 Varieties and Distinctions</h2><ul><li>There's a sexual sense of modesty. Monetary sense of modesty.</li><li>Humility is often considered synonymous with modesty, but not always.</li></ul><h2 class="">1.2 Key Features</h2><h2 class="">1.3 Normative Status</h2><ul><li>Aquinas considered both to be types of temperance? (not sure what that means)</li><li>Some say modesty is public, humility private. Humility is underrating oneself, modesty is not. Consideration of these terms vary.</li><li>Modesty as internal state versus or along with external behavior - seems the internal mental state is required.</li><li>Self-attribution of modesty seems self-undermining.<ul><li>'Bernard Williams, for example, writes that “… it is a notorious truth that a modest person does not act under the title of modesty”'</li></ul></li><li>It is claimed that Aristotle and Hume deny that modesty or humility are virtuous.<ul><li>Aristotle might be talking about shame and not modesty. Also writes about the truthful person being inclined to understate the truth.</li><li>Hume derides &quot;monkish virtues&quot; that are self-denials which *masquerade* as virtues that can &quot; stupefy the understanding and harden the heart, obscure the fancy and sour the temper&quot;</li></ul></li><li>Lots of discussion of humility as a religious virtue, making one open to God's grace.</li><li>Non-religious effects such as combating jealousy and smoothing social interactions</li></ul><h2 class="">2. Doxastic accounts</h2><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxastic_logic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxastic_logic</a>
&lt;&lt;&lt;
Doxastic logic is a type of logic concerned with reasoning about beliefs. The term doxastic derives from the ancient Greek δόξα, doxa, which means &quot;belief&quot;. Typically, a doxastic logic uses to mean &quot;It is believed that is the case&quot;, and the set denotes a set of beliefs.
&lt;&lt;&lt;</p><ul><li>Ignorance accounts versus accuracy accounts</li></ul><h2 class="">2.1 Ignorance</h2><ul><li>Wherein humility is about someone being ignorant of their own good qualities</li><li>Also could be called an underestimation account</li><li>Some formulations of this seem to suggest moral virtue requires actual ignorance &amp; false beliefs about one's own qualities</li></ul><h2 class="">2.2 Strong Accuracy</h2><ul><li>Strong accuracy accounts deny that modesty is compatible with ignorance. Modesty is at heart about having true beliefs about oneself</li><li>As a corrective to a general human tendency to think too highly of ourselves</li><li>Explain modesty &amp; humility with an appeal to knowledge, both for practical norms &amp; abstract ideals</li></ul><h2 class="">2.3 Weak Accuracy</h2><ul><li>Looser consideration - maybe all it takes is just not over-estimating onesself as a kind of shortcut that trends toward accuracy</li><li>Also de-emphasis in public while privately being aware of good qualities</li></ul><h2 class="">3 Non-Doxastic Accounts</h2><h2 class="">3.2 Indifference</h2><ul><li>Roberts and Wood (2003) discuss humility as opposed to vanity and arrogance. Lacking vanity means being unconcerned with others' opinions. Lacking arrogance means being unconcerned with social entitlements.</li><li>Buddhist thinkers oppose pride or arrogance and indifference to self-attachment that produces suffering.</li></ul><h2 class="">3.3 Asymmetry</h2><ul><li>There's a difference between &quot;I deserve applause&quot; and &quot;she deserves applause&quot;</li><li>One can express kindness &amp; concern for others while still retaining internal accuracy about one's own self-assessments (or not)</li></ul><h2 class="">3.5 Attention</h2><ul><li>Modesty can be personal inattention to one's own good self qualities.</li></ul><h2 class="">3.6 Executive</h2><ul><li>Modesty as a will-power virtue - courage, self-control, patience</li><li>Functions as a brake on bad tendencies.</li></ul><h2 class="">4 Epistemology</h2><ul><li>Modesty and humility relate to how we consider the truth or rationality of our own beliefs about our good qualities, independent of their objective metric</li><li>This is separate from moral value judgements</li></ul><h2 class="">4.1 Anti-Expertise</h2><ul><li>An anti-expert is reliably wrong about a topic. It's rationally unacceptable to believe oneself is an anti-expert</li><li>This is a difficulty in being modest: One has difficulty thinking their own faculties are anti-reliable</li></ul><h2 class="">4.2 Disagreement</h2><ul><li>In disagreements, modesty suggests one be less confident in one's own position against someone else with similar evidence and faculties.</li></ul><h2 class="">4.3 Intellectual Humility</h2><ul><li>Epistemic virtue in that it keeps one open to learning and aware of self-limitations</li></ul><h2 class="">4.4 Open-Mindedness</h2><ul><li>Treating evidence in an impartial way</li><li>Willingness to consider alternate self-narratives</li><li>Freedom from certain mental habits involving the self and its place in the world</li></ul><h2 class="">5 Conclusion</h2><ul><li>What kinds of self-attitudes enable the exercise of virtue?</li><li>What features of self are salient to a virtuous person?</li><li>&quot;Careful theorizing about the nature of modesty and humility helps to shape and inform these larger questions in ethics and epistemology.&quot;</li></ul></div>
