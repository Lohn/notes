* Nothing much dumped here today - I spent pretty much the whole day finishing the third-to-last chapter of the [book][].

* So, I'd thought that the upload script was working, but it was failing on the SSH auth part of the rsync.  Seems to be working again now.

* Since I end up using a lot of the same links repeatedly, some sort of link palette or persistent link notepad would be nice.

* Still thinking a feed-to-markdown thing would work nicely for copying over links to things I've bookmarked, made favorite, or whatever.
