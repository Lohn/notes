* Considering a trip to [SuperHappyDevHouse 25][shdh] tomorrow.
    
    * I should probably try working on writing there.

    * But I might also work on this bucket and a few other things.

    * And I really should try to mingle a bit and make a few last connections with people before [we move][move].

        * I'm hoping I can finagle a way to return to CA on a schedule that coincides with future SHDH happenings, but who knows?

* Today was a day of Mozilla work from home, followed by an evening of book work from home.

    * I feel like I've read every line of [mootools-trunk-1553.js][moo]. 
        
        * I've probably missed a bunch of things.

        * On the other hand, I think I found a few bugs too - I wonder if and how I should file those with that community.

            * Oh, hey, [they use Trac][mootrac].

* [Firefox 3.0 RC1][ff] dropped today!

    * I'm amazed at how much smoother and quicker all the animation examples for the book seem to go!

* [Real Synthetic Audio][syn] is one of my favorite music podcasts evar.

    * [IPM Radio][ipm] is pretty dang nifty as well.
