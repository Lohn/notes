* Since I'm walking distance from Google now, I should see who I know over there who might want to share a table for lunch.

* Hitting the home stretch on writing my part of [Professional JavaScript Frameworks][book].  The first half or so went pretty well, but the last month or so has brought a legendary number of disruptions.  I'm hoping to write about them all soon.

* Once finished with the [book][], I hope to have a brief period of getting my shit together before starting to do serially enthusiastic things again.

* I'm also yak shaving and procrastinating a bit in this home stretch, trying to think of sufficiently interesting things to say about what's been happening with me and what it feels like to be a newbie at [Mozilla][].

* There's a lot of awesome here at [Mozilla][] that's making me feel the need to step up again.

* More stuff I want to do things with:
    * OpenID
    * OAuth
    * AtomPub

* Been reading [Let's Tell a Story Together](http://home.grandecom.net/~maher/if-book/).  Here's a goal: Complete at least one work of interactive fiction per month.

* Wondering if scheduling some serial enthusiasms with deadlines over the summer and fall might help me get some interesting things done.  Like:
    * July: 
        * Record a limited run podcast, say 10 episodes or so.
        * Build something with OpenID, OAuth, and AtomPub
        * Write up the experience of building the above.
    * August: 
        * Compose a work of interactive fiction
        * Write up the experience of building the above.
        * Write a few serial short stories
    * September: 
        * Revisit podcasting?  Podcast the serial stories?
        * Write up the experience of building the above.

* Be careful using images hosted on my site.  You might get nipples.

* Still haven't pushed this thing live anywhere yet.
* Still talking to myself and wibbling over format.
    * Should an `<hr />` indicate a new entry?  What about an `<h1>`?
* Want to spend some time giving this thing a *bit* of style.
    * No more Times New Roman.
    * Narrow column width.
* Really need to implement comments in Markdown to hide my Vim modeline.

/* vim: set formatoptions=l lbr syntax=mkd columns=94 lines=64: */
