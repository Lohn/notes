* Apropos of [my US$0.02 on Markdown yesterday][humanity], an app idea occured to me:

    * GreaseMonkey script that uses [Showdown][] to turn all `<textareas>` into Markdown fields, like [I did for hCal awhile ago][hcal].

        * Write in Markdown
        * Get previews in-line or in a popup
        * Submit raw HTML

* Yesterday, I managed to write something longer than the usual quick thought, about Markdown.

    * I think it really pushed the usefulness of this thing, and belongs in a full-on blog post after lots of editing.

    * I met [Rohit Khare][rk] for the first time at SHDH yesterday.  Upon my being introduced, he recognized my name from the [SHDH 25][shdh] who's who listâ€”mainly because of how unreadable this bucket composition was.
