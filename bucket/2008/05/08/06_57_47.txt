# Random

* It's kind of weird starting work for a company where almost everything I'm starting to learn, install, and work on are all already open source.

* I have a list of things brewing in my head that guy I want to be when I grow up would be doing interesting things with: 
    * Here are a few off the top:
        * [Inform 7](http://www.inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html)
        * Jabber
        * Podcasting
        * Storytelling and fiction writing
    * What's keeping me?
        * That's an interesting question.

* Just when I was thinking I wish I had a command-line tool to look at what Time Machine was doing, [behold it appears](http://fernlightning.com/doku.php?id=software:misc:tms)!

* If ever I turn this thing into a web app, I'll think about making [a textarea work like Vim](http://gpl.internetconnection.net/vi/)

# Metabucket

So I'm just going to start writing this blog on my laptop using [Blosxom][] and see if I actually manage to capture some ideas, even if only I'm reading them for now.

This thing isn't going to be solved by software - at least not at first and not ever entirely.  To get it going, I'm going to just open a Vim window and start spewing into a text file and let [Blosxom][] feed from the directory.

Is "bucket" a good name for this thing?  I keep thinking I want to come up with some coffee-based pun for it that's not yet been used by a Java project.

## Some goals for this thing:

* Turn the page daily.
* Keep the page one hotkey or Quicksilver access away.
* No structure, titles, or anything decided up front.
* Must be as quick and easy as tweeting to Twitter.
* Must be dead simpler than WordPress.
* Must absorb a day's worth of dithering before bothering feed subscribers.
* Should capture ideas and lend itself toward the shaping of more proper long-play blog entries.
* Should make it easy for me to occasionally pull in and comment upon items I've shared / bookmarked / gathered using other services.
* Develop a style that could evolve naturally into microcontent.
* Develop some creative constraints ala Twitter's 140 or Ficlet's 1024 characters.
* Accumulate features a bit at a time, but just start writing.

## TODO

* Feed-to-Markdown script
    * Fuels cut-n-paste link palettes
* Pre-filter for Markdown
    * Omit /* */ comments
    * Quick notation for anchors
    * Anchors for H1-H6
    * Anchors for HR
    * Discuss / Haloscan comments for each anchor
* Post-filter for Markdown
    * Convert some links into embeds
        * ie. YouTube videos

Code so far, in a midnight crontab:

    BASE=$HOME/Documents/bucket/entries; 
    NOW=`date +%Y-%m-%d`
    NOW_FN=$BASE/`date +%Y/%m/%d-%H_%M_%S.txt`; 
    NOW_DIR=`dirname $NOW_FN`; 

    mkdir -p $NOW_DIR; 
    mv $BASE/now.txt $NOW_FN; 
    echo "bucket for $NOW"  > $BASE/now.txt
    echo "" >> $BASE/now.txt

/* vim: set formatoptions=l lbr syntax=mkd columns=94 lines=64: */
