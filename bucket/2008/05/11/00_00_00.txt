* More things to remember to play with:
   * Google Gears
   * Dojo Offline
   * Get back to XoxoOutliner someday

* Oh hey, my laptop's on PDT time and my server's on UTC time.  That'll affect Blosxom date headers a bit, ugh.

* Okay, so I slapped together a quick CSS theme and an rsync-based uploader running every 10 minutes.  It's live, after a fashion.

* I've also hacked the feed not to include the most recent entry that I'm editing right now.  That's important, and hopefully I'll explain soon.

* There's not much to this thing yet besides Blosxom and a handful of shell scripts that:
   1. Rotate my always-open editor to a new blank file at midnight.
   1. Upload everything to my server every 10 minutes.
   1. Can open the editor from Quicksilver if I happened to have closed it.

   Keeping it stupidly simple for now.  Maybe I'll keep using it.

* Thinking of borrowing my Haloscan comments integration from my [OPML blog](http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad) and trying it here too.  

* Also thinking of trying Disqus, but not sure it lends itself well to this thing.

* Maybe midnight-process the single day's bucket into multiple entries, cut on `<hr>` and entitled with first `<h1>`
* Use some ASCII-text convention for embedding link anchors.
* Possibly attach delicious-style tags to anchors for future lookup and search.
