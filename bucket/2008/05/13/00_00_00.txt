* I [added the bucket to my accumulator][added], which should be interesting to watch when the "final" version of each day's bucket shows up in the feed.

* At some point, I want to return to that [accumulator](http://decafbad.com/accum/) and implement the custom feed filtering stuff I meant to do.  That way, I can offer feeds that gather:
    * a firehose of everything I emit online;
    * just the stuff I emit to decafbad.com;
    * just the long-form articles and posts.

* Time soon to check this bucket stuff into SVN, since it's grown to about a half-dozen scripts and templates.  There's some content accumulated, too.

* Tossed in some Haloscan comment links next to the titles.  I'm also thinking about switching to Disqus if I can find a clean way to integrate.
    * [This](http://benjamingolub.com/2008/03/03/how-to-dynamic-slide-down-disqus-comments/) might offer a clue toward the Disqus integration I want.

* Hmm.  I wonder how hard it would be to tell blosxom to mind the creation date and not modification date on these entries?
    * I remember playing with plugins and other `touch`-based hackery to sort this kind of thing out, years ago.

* Have a passing thought that I might convert everything from my [OPML blog][opml] into entries for this bucket.  They're very, very similar in spirit.
