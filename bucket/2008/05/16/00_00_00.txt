* Attached a patch to [a bug][bug] today, and watched it get announced in an IRC channel.  Like, in public.  This'll take some getting used to.

* [As seen on Twitter][biked], I biked to work today.  It was only about 11 miles from Santa Clara to Mountain View, but that was enough for me.  
    
    * But, it wasn't *too much* for me.  I've only got about a month left out here in CA, but I wonder if I might just keep this up.

    * Oh yeah, and I wore [this snazzy Firefox cycling jersey][jersey].  I felt at once silly and like a superhero.

* Once upon a time, about 5 or 6 years ago if I recall, I quit smoking cold turkey.  Having done that, I feel like I can do damn near anything sometimes.

    * The trick is remembering that feeling.

    * And the other trick—as I find it currently difficult to rise from the couch with muscles overused through 22 miles of bike riding today—is not to overdo it.

* Seems like [Twitter is down][down] again.  Makes me happy I have a bucket.

* I need to collect bucket thoughts in order to compose a long-form blog post explaining and introducing the thing.  Maybe it'll happen under this bullet.

    * Or, maybe not.
