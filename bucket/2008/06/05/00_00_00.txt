* Thinking I'll soon stop redirecting [decafbad.com][db] to my accumulator and replace it with a simpler intro page with big buttons pointing at my big topics, maybe with a few teaser bits.

* Project idea: Replace / rework my accumulator with a daily bucket fed from FriendFeed.
    
    * Accumulate a day's worth of FriendFeed droppings, archive by date in static files.

        * Could this just be an augmentation to [Venus][]?

    * Leave the door open to replace FriendFeed with my own parts.

        * Or maybe skip FriendFeed and stick with plain old feed fetching.

    * Copy FriendFeed's presentation for grouping and collapsing multiple successive updates for a given service.

        * Listening to a few hours of music makes [last.fm][lastfm] noisy.
