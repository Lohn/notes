* Looks like my adoption curve for this, yet another blogging tool, is falling off like usual.  Maybe faster than usual.  Not sure what that means yet.

* Trying to read [Shadow Unit][su], because I really love the concept of writing episodes for a TV series that never aired.

    * Part of the reason I love the concept of [Shadow Unit][su] is that I'm thinking about doing something similar myself.

    * But, I can't really get into it, because I'm just not into cop / profiler shows.

        * The one exception lately might be [Dexter][de], but there's more creep than procedure going on there.
