Up a few hours earlier than usual to ferry the girl to the airport for a visit back to Michigan to be a bridesmaid in a wedding." created="Fri, 02 Nov 2007 12:37:23 GMT"/>		<outline text="Kind of sad that my build of the OPML Editor seems to have downgraded slightly under Leopard.  Word wrap doesn't work in outlines, in particular, and the menu bar does this weird checkerboard thing occasionally.  Probably artifacts of the murmurings I'm hearing about Carbon's days being numbered." created="Fri, 02 Nov 2007 12:38:16 GMT"/>		<outline text="In my serial enthusiasm, I wonder briefly if &lt;a href=&quot;http://lmorchard.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; might deserve some renewed attention - or if it's about time I do something more useful with &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner&quot;&gt;XoxoOutliner&lt;/a&gt;, which has spoken to an OPML Community Server before.  Might be nice to cobble together a &lt;a href=&quot;http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/10/23/site-specific-browsers-and-greasekit/&quot;&gt;site-specific browser&lt;/a&gt; with an outliner in it." created="Fri, 02 Nov 2007 12:44:13 GMT"/>		<outline text="I kind of use the OPML Editor like a not-so-media-rich &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblelog&quot;&gt;tumblelog&lt;/a&gt;, but two things I really like about it more than any other web publishing tool I've poked at so far is that 1) it's centered around a page-a-day, and 2) it's an independent non-browser app window giving me a whole day's worth of blatherings to manipulate and consider.  No web forms, no mentally heavy &quot;I Am Publishing A Media And/Or Textual Object With A Form On The Interweb Now&quot; process.  I just cmd-tab over, click, hit enter, type, and save." created="Fri, 02 Nov 2007 12:44:21 GMT"/>		<outline text="Both &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.songbirdnest.com/node/2245&quot;&gt;Songbird&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://flock.com/&quot;&gt;Flock&lt;/a&gt; just released new versions - both are Mozilla-based apps.  Installing both, and going to check them out.  Seems like they have a lot of potential." created="Fri, 02 Nov 2007 15:07:08 GMT"/>		</body>	</opml>
