I keep thinking I might like some form of tumblelogging software better than the OPML Editor, especially since there've been some weird behaviors for me since installing Leopard.  Maybe I could finally try using Tinderbox for blogging. But, here I am, opening the OPML Editor again.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2007/11/02#When:4:44:21AM&quot;&gt;I just can't leave it yet&lt;/a&gt;.  :)" created="Wed, 07 Nov 2007 00:17:59 GMT"/>		<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2007/11/02#When:4:38:16AM&quot;&gt;My issue with word wrap in the OPML Editor in Leopard&lt;/a&gt; only seems to happen when I'm using the Inconsolata font.

This makes me feel guilty I'm not fixing bugs I find.  But alas, I despair at wrapping my head around its source and around non-Cocoa MacOS development.  I figure it's enough that I know a bit about UserTalk, but hesitate to dive into the code behind the curtain.  Maybe someday..." created="Wed, 07 Nov 2007 00:37:20 GMT"/>		</body>	</opml>
