Do I post in reverse-chonological order?  Sometimes it makes sense to read the day as a whole in narrative sequence.  Sometimes it makes sense to tail a log.  This is a little different than &quot;normal&quot; blogging." created="Wed, 27 Jun 2007 04:10:50 GMT"/>		<outline text="I like how &lt;a href=&quot;http://anarchaia.org/&quot;&gt;Christian Neukirchen's Anarchaia&lt;/a&gt; tumbles out a day-at-a-time on the feeds.

It's fun to watch him start spinning up on an idea.  This time, it's Twitter and little MP3s.  Not sure if &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twittergram.com/&quot;&gt;TwitterGrams&lt;/a&gt; will take off, but podcasting &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/11/payloadsForRss.html&quot;&gt;looked like this&lt;/a&gt; at one point." created="Wed, 27 Jun 2007 02:49:33 GMT"/>		<outline text="Still in a bit of a creative / hacking slump, but I wonder if it would be fun to lash something together out of some scripting, some S3, some Twitter API, and some other bits and bobs?  Could be like a real ambient stream of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2007/05/16#damnKidsGetOffMyWeb&quot;&gt;coffee-shop background chatter&lt;/a&gt;.

At the time, I was reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbows_End&quot;&gt;Vernor Vinge's &lt;i&gt;Rainbows End&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has lots of scenes of near-future internetworked human collaboration and lots of ambient presence through wearables." created="Wed, 27 Jun 2007 04:03:16 GMT"/>		<outline text="It's all kind of geeky and gawky right now, where things exist or work at all.  But, I remember when &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; was really gawky - and am less so now.  I'm even more geeky, but I like to think I've matured.
