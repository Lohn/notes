Faster than any web app.  As demonstrated when I'm not using it, I'm silent for months.  And it's an outliner.  I love outliners - maybe even moreso than mind mappers, though I like those too.

My build of the OPML Editor - taken from SVN on SourceForge - has a nasty memory leak that I don't know enough to diagnose and dig out.  Eats all my RAM over the course of a few hours, then crashes.  I feel the itch to build a new quick blogging tool, but must resist." created="Sat, 09 Jun 2007 01:19:19 GMT"/>		<outline text="Hello world.  It's our one-year anniversary tomorrow!
