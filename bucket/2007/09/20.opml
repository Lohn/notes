A serial port, a parallel port, and two PC card slots.  No USB.  DOS.  Runs on 2 AA batteries, reads great in sunlight, and has a usable QWERTY keyboard.  I used it in college to write quite a few papers and stories.  I wonder if I could somehow get it working again usefully with a MacBook Pro and other modern technology for writing on the bus?" created="Thu, 20 Sep 2007 18:08:50 GMT"/>		<outline text="Finally checked out the new Apple iPods in person this week.  Love the iPod Touch.  But, I'm not a big fan of the weird pillowy-bevel metal thing on the iPod Classic, nor that plus the squat-form of the new iPod Nano.  I think I'd like the design if it were still some form of plastic and not aluminum and steel.  Half-heartedly got an eye out to upgrade my 4th Gen 20GB iPod, but it won't be from this generation I don't think." created="Thu, 20 Sep 2007 20:55:15 GMT"/>		</body>	</opml>
