Haven't biked to work in awhile - morning weather's been a bit intimidating and night gets dark early.  Pitiful excuse, I know.  I'll just have to get past that soon." created="Wed, 17 Oct 2007 15:10:38 GMT"/>		<outline text="Maybe I'll ride my bike to work today.

I actually cross-posted &lt;b&gt;two&lt;/b&gt; things today.  Let's see if I manage to do it again soon, and hopefully not in a way that's so annoying to people weird enough to watch this feed &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; decafbad.com" created="Thu, 18 Oct 2007 03:38:54 GMT"/>		<outline text="This OPML Editor is just too easy to use in capturing and releasing ideas.  I keep returning to it because it's so seamless between this editor window and the web.  No browsers, no round-trip form submissions, tiny mental cost to switching over to the app and spewing things into the document.  I consider this site to be something inbetween Twitter and my blog proper." created="Thu, 18 Oct 2007 03:44:55 GMT"/>		<outline text="Twitter's Mojo Bubble" created="Thu, 18 Oct 2007 03:37:56 GMT">			<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/analysts/gartenberg/archives/2007/10/still_not_twitt.html&quot;&gt;Michael Gartenberg&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;First, it's another queue to check. ... It looks like I could add Twitter into the flow of RSS feeds but do I really want to do that?&quot;  &lt;i&gt;No, you don't want to do that.&lt;/i&gt;" created="Wed, 17 Oct 2007 21:21:32 GMT"/>			<outline text="If you're &quot;checking your Twitter queue&quot; - you're doing it wrong.  You should be using something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific&quot;&gt;Twitteriffic&lt;/a&gt; or a good IM client that semi-unobtrusively surfaces recent Twitter activity in the periphery of your screen.  Things either catch your eye occasionally, or the messages pass you by.  It's okay to miss things.  In fact, it's mandatory to miss lots of things at a fully attentive and conscious level." created="Wed, 17 Oct 2007 21:22:03 GMT"/>			<outline text="And, if you think &quot;I'm going to post to my Twitter Blog now&quot; - you're doing it wrong in that way too.  You should be absentmindedly emitting something barely edited and pondered from your stream of consciousness every now and then.  Maybe drop something a little more well-considered every now and then.  But, spend any more than 3 seconds or so at a time spewing something into the ether, and you've missed the Twitter magic." created="Wed, 17 Oct 2007 21:24:33 GMT"/>			<outline text="This stance toward Twitter interaction is where I find the mojo.  Outside of those fine lines, the Twitter soap bubble bursts and the magic smoke escapes." created="Wed, 17 Oct 2007 21:27:52 GMT"/>			</outline>		<outline text="Wine is Nicely Enabled" created="Thu, 18 Oct 2007 03:37:40 GMT">			<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tuxmachines.org/node/21069&quot;&gt;Wine is Getting Good&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Anyone else notice lately how good Wine is getting?&quot;" created="Thu, 18 Oct 2007 03:10:34 GMT"/>			<outline text="I haven't checked &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.winehq.org&quot;&gt;Wine&lt;/a&gt; out in awhile, but I'm a big fan.  I was using it to run &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com/&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand&lt;/a&gt; under Linux, about 4 or 5 years ago.  I've kind of assumed that Wine would get Good Enough at some point to run almost everything that matters that was written for Win95, Win98, Win2K, and eventually even WinXP.  And, games aside, pretty much everything that matters and that anyone bothers with runs on this range of Windows versions.  And, seeing as Windows Vista hasn't exactly set the world afire, I'm betting that Wine might actually have a chance to catch up well enough to be trouble." created="Thu, 18 Oct 2007 03:11:01 GMT"/>			<outline text="Oh yeah, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxmac&quot;&gt;CrossOver Mac&lt;/a&gt; is based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.winehq.org&quot;&gt;Wine&lt;/a&gt;.  And &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tuaw.com/2007/10/04/crossover-6-2-supports-team-fortress-2/&quot;&gt;CrossOver Mac supports Team Fortress 2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;b&gt;right now&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;without purchase of a Windows license&lt;/i&gt;.  Think about that.  So, maybe we shouldn't put games aside.  Really, unless Microsoft can somehow patent the crucial APIs exposed by Windows, resistance is futile.  There are nerds motiviated and annoyed enough to reverse engineer and assimilate.  I'm not a lawyer, though:  I suppose by the point Wine actually becomes a threat of any sort, nasty things can be sprung." created="Thu, 18 Oct 2007 03:14:24 GMT"/>			</outline>		</body>	</opml>
