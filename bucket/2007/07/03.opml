It does this with extension tags in a new XML namespace, with unobtrusive JS enhancement, and using a simple server-side PHP proxy to sidestep cross-domain issues.  It lets you pretty granularly address other docs on the web down, using xpath and IDs to locate desired content.  I need to think about some fun things to do with it." created="Tue, 03 Jul 2007 20:45:16 GMT"/>		<outline text="The thing that's interesting to me about the lack of a clipboard and prevalence of sending email to get info out of the iPhone is that that's how my crappy little cell phone works already.  So, I've been poking around for years at using email to shuttle bits around to myself and to services.  I email links to myself for desktop reading, I have an email filter that shuffles certain subject lines to a text file at a private URL, etc." created="Tue, 03 Jul 2007 17:28:21 GMT"/>		<outline text="I'm thinking that &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogrium.com/&quot;&gt;Jeff Lindsay&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogrium.com/2007/01/18/mailhook/&quot;&gt;Mailhook&lt;/a&gt; suddenly looks more useful." created="Tue, 03 Jul 2007 17:31:11 GMT"/>		<outline text="Someone needs to send me an iPhone, contract pre-paid.  I'll do interesting things with it, in return.  Will work for iPhone?  :)  (Yes, I realize that this will not happen.)" created="Tue, 03 Jul 2007 17:31:59 GMT"/>		<outline text="Since I've been using the OPML Editor again for haphazard tumblelogging / outline blogging, I've been wondering if the whole &quot;Edit this Page&quot; one-page-a-day thing from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html&quot;&gt;Manilla&lt;/a&gt; days might be worth more fully reviving.  Dial up the granularity from individual outline notes up to full days, offer separate feeds for real-time updates and daily finished pages.  Get my &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner&quot;&gt;XoxoOutliner&lt;/a&gt;, slap it on WordPress, cobble together good OPML Community Server API support.  It's not new or anything, but might be worth revisiting." created="Tue, 03 Jul 2007 15:16:38 GMT"/>		<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pownce.com/kevin/notes/28985/#note29863&quot;&gt;Enclosure elements on Pownce RSS feeds&lt;/a&gt; would be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.scifihifi.com/2005/10/17/recombinant-podcasting/&quot;&gt;recombinant podcasting killer app&lt;/a&gt;." created="Tue, 03 Jul 2007 14:44:24 GMT"/>		<outline text="That reminds me:  Maybe an auto-assembled podcast of TwitterGrams would be more interesting right now than a streaming station that mostly plays birdsong filler.  Although I have gotten some good feedback on offering just a relaxing stream of birds twittering away." created="Tue, 03 Jul 2007 15:14:26 GMT"/>		<outline text="Hello world.
