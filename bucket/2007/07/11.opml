I'm exhausted - slept in the clinic last night, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/tags/wires/&quot;&gt;covered in wires&lt;/a&gt;.  To get a good natural reading from me they kept me off &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPAP&quot;&gt;CPAP&lt;/a&gt; for half the night, so that was a disaster in terms of actual rest.  I think I got about 2 or 3 actual hours' sleep once they put me back on the breathing machine.  Woke up with a raw throat, a nasty limpy leg cramp, and a seriously cranky mood.  Hoping I'll at least be somewhat productive today.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/deusx/776293449/&quot;&gt;Serious business&lt;/a&gt;, this &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea&quot;&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;." created="Wed, 11 Jul 2007 14:27:53 GMT"/>		<outline text="One side effect of Yahoo!

It's just that it seems to have won the war so far in hosting penetration.  I've had dalliances with Twisted over the past few years - and though I do dig quite a lot about it, it seems to have quite a high bar for adoption.  (Keep in mind I've been considering WordPress as a role model.)" created="Thu, 12 Jul 2007 03:48:56 GMT"/>		<outline text="The more I think about the Zend Framework, the less I think I'm actually all that enamored with it.  The docs need work, some bits seem missing or clunky, and I catch small hints here and there that there's a bit of flutter in the consistency of the framework's development process and goals.  One funny thing, though, is that there's a Zend office almost within walking distance of our apartment.  I wonder if I could walk down there and have a chat about things?  :)" created="Thu, 12 Jul 2007 04:03:53 GMT"/>		</body>	</opml>
