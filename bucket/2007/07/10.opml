Going to be sleeping at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caminomedical.org/sleep/&quot;&gt;a clinic&lt;/a&gt; tonight for my first sleep apnea re-test in years.  This should be interesting." created="Tue, 10 Jul 2007 14:38:56 GMT"/>		<outline text="Trying something slightly in writing here different today - going to try to arrange outline notes in some top-down narrative order.  So, if you start from &quot;Hello world&quot; at the beginning of the day and read down, it should at least make sense as a ramble across the day." created="Tue, 10 Jul 2007 21:31:21 GMT"/>		<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/07/10/mobileStories.html&quot;&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;All the more reason why I need the OPML Editor (an instance of the Frontier scripting environment) running in mobile form.&quot;" created="Wed, 11 Jul 2007 00:20:11 GMT"/>		<outline text="Hmm, I've got most of the parts - in rough form - to build &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XoxoOutliner&quot;&gt;a browser-based outliner&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/XoxoOutliner/js/myXMLRPC.js&quot;&gt;speaks XML-RPC via AJAX&lt;/a&gt; back to an OPML Community Server.  I wonder if I could finish it and make it work?  And I wonder if it would work on an iPhone?  Hmm, it uses a lot of keyboard shortcuts - I wonder how the touch interface could translate to browser events and a useful outlining environment?" created="Wed, 11 Jul 2007 00:20:31 GMT"/>		<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.useit.com/alertbox/articles-not-blogs.html&quot;&gt;Jakob Nielsen&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;...I recommended that he should instead invest his time in writing thorough articles that he published on a regular schedule.  Given limited time, this means not spending the effort to post numerous short comments on ongoing blogosphere discussions.&quot;" created="Tue, 10 Jul 2007 14:57:59 GMT"/>		<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/tommorris/statuses/143803932&quot;&gt;Tom Morris&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Perhaps someone should put a gun to Jakob Nielsen's head and force him to Twitter.

The funny thing is, I tend to think that given limited time, I won't often cross the threshold toward writing articles.  Thus, if I limited myself to that, then nothing would get from my head to the web.  I'll stay quiet, as I've demonstrated throughout the past few years.  I suppose if my rambings here are annoying, that might be a good thing.  But, I have found some value to just floating a stream of small thought bubbles, any one of which might expand into something bigger when they run into others'." created="Tue, 10 Jul 2007 14:58:27 GMT"/>		<outline text="More random web framework thoughts:  It actually surprises me that PHP 5 is so low in adoption as to require a &lt;a href=&quot;http://gophp5.org/&quot;&gt;Go PHP 5&lt;/a&gt; campaign.  The more I think about it, I wonder if an insistence on PHP 5 actually wrecks the idea of &quot;runs where WordPress does&quot; for all practical purposes?  And, if that idea's wrecked - would the bar for installing something like a Django app be significantly higher?  Because, really, ubiquity is &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; single reason I'm even bothering with PHP.  But that tolerance is thin enough that I'm not willing to put up with PHP 4.  Life's too short." created="Tue, 10 Jul 2007 18:09:20 GMT"/>		</body>	</opml>
