The CPAP makes me dizzy when I get up, I think.  The new machine's set to much higher pressure.  But, I'd rather deal with this for an hour or two than fall asleep at my desk." created="Tue, 21 Aug 2007 14:33:29 GMT"/>		<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/08/21/richerNamespacesForTwitter.html&quot;&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;As Twitter evolves, maybe the URLs will get longer?  Imagine what might go at: http://twitter.com/davewiner/gnomedex  All twits that I post while at Gnomedex?

From 5787998 to 218773732 in under a year.  That's a lot of chatter.  They probably &lt;a href=&quot;http://joshua.schachter.org/2007/01/autoincrement.html&quot;&gt;shouldn't be using autoincrement IDs in URLs&lt;/a&gt;, but oh well." created="Tue, 21 Aug 2007 21:30:23 GMT"/>		<outline text="Sticky Tags for Twitter?" created="Wed, 22 Aug 2007 04:21:10 GMT">			<outline text="I should elaborate on what I mean by &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/lmorchard/statuses/218773732&quot;&gt;tags in Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, since I got a few head-scratching responses." created="Wed, 22 Aug 2007 04:13:20 GMT"/>			<outline text="No, fitting tags into the 140 characters for a message won't work.  And, no, tagging every tweet as you go is a horrible approach - no one will do it." created="Wed, 22 Aug 2007 04:21:35 GMT"/>			<outline text="What I've thought might work, though, are &lt;i&gt;sticky tags&lt;/i&gt;.  Sticky tags would persist from update to update.  From the web UI, you could drop &quot;work&quot; or &quot;gnomedex&quot; or &quot;l:95051 beer concert somerandomband&quot; into an additional tags field and all tweets from then on will gain those tags until you empty the tag field." created="Wed, 22 Aug 2007 04:21:07 GMT"/>			<outline text="There could be shortcut commands - ala &quot;d someone&quot; for direct messaging - to change or clear tags.  This would especially useful while out and about and mobile.  Say you text &quot;t bus commute&quot; to Twitter when you get on the bus for home, then anything you might emit from then until you change the tags gets the tags &quot;bus&quot; and &quot;commute&quot; applied." created="Wed, 22 Aug 2007 04:22:59 GMT"/>			<outline text="Then, you and others could follow this particular thread of tweets via http://twitter.com/yourname/commute - or even ala delicious: http://twitter.com/yourname/commute+bus." created="Wed, 22 Aug 2007 04:24:14 GMT"/>			<outline text="Going to be at SxSW for awhile?  Drop &quot;sxsw&quot; into your sticky tags.  Maybe someday everyone who doesn't want to hear it can filter out tweets with that tag rather than stop following you altogether." created="Wed, 22 Aug 2007 04:25:13 GMT"/>			<outline text="Having some sticky tags can allow a bit of metadata and filtering hooks to follow you for awhile without requiring you to do or remember much.  Keeping them as free-form text strings allows some cow-pathing as people invent conventions." created="Wed, 22 Aug 2007 04:25:44 GMT"/>			<outline text="Think of these tags as kind of long-running &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-status.
