Happy August.  I can't believe it's been over a year since we moved to California." created="Wed, 01 Aug 2007 14:57:53 GMT"/>		<outline text="Whoa, &lt;a href=&quot;http://eastgate.com/Tinderbox/updates/Tinderbox400.html&quot;&gt;Tinderbox 4.0.0 for OS X&lt;/a&gt; is out.  I need to seriously consider this upgrade." created="Wed, 01 Aug 2007 17:29:48 GMT"/>		<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://lmorchard.jaiku.com/&quot;&gt;My Jaiku page&lt;/a&gt; seems to be doing a good job of aggregating my output streams into one place.  Just noticed my OPML blog isn't in there." created="Wed, 01 Aug 2007 18:25:40 GMT"/>		<outline text="Hmm.  Added my OPML blog to &lt;a href=&quot;http://lmorchard.jaiku.com/&quot;&gt;my Jaiku profile&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems like Jaiku only picks up the titles of RSS items and not the descriptions - at least from this feed.  Alas, most of my micro-blogging here goes title-less." created="Wed, 01 Aug 2007 18:31:00 GMT"/>		<outline text="One of the reasons I like micro-blogging with the OPML Editor versus something like Tumblr or Twitter is that I get to see the context of my day so far.  I can review the small things I've jotted so far, build on them, rearrange them, play with them.  The whole day worth of items is a fluid assembly of loose parts.  I'm trying to think how this sort of experience could be replicated in a purely browser-resident app." created="Wed, 01 Aug 2007 18:23:44 GMT"/>		<outline text="On the other hand, finally exploring how to blog with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://eastgate.com/Tinderbox/updates/Tinderbox400.html&quot;&gt;the new Tinderbox from Eastgate for OS X&lt;/a&gt; is somewhat tempting.  Now, that's &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; a fluid assembly of loose parts that invites play." created="Wed, 01 Aug 2007 18:28:40 GMT"/>		<outline text="An &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/08/01/whatAboutFeedburner.html&quot;&gt;Open Source FeedBurner&lt;/a&gt;?  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sawickipedia.com/blog/2007/08/01/winers-on-to-something-here-open-source-feedburner-that-is/&quot;&gt;A good idea?&lt;/a&gt;  Hmm, maybe I should dust off my &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/FeedMagick&quot;&gt;FeedMagick&lt;/a&gt; stuff sometime soon.  It's &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/2007/04/FeedMagick2/&quot;&gt;still running over here&lt;/a&gt;.  Granted, what I've been doing is more like &lt;a href=&quot;pipes.yahoo.com&quot;&gt;pipes.yahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;, but it's got some FeedBurner-like potential too.  I've got some ideas for an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/automator/&quot;&gt;Automator&lt;/a&gt;-like UI, and have an urge to hack on feeds again." created="Thu, 02 Aug 2007 03:44:04 GMT"/>		</body>	</opml>
