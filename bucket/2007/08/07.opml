Day 2 of biking to work, better than Day 1, but still tiring.  I'll need to give myself a break at some point soon - &quot;Don't make yourself hate the bike,&quot; said a friend / co-worker - but I think I need to push hard enough to get past inertia and convince myself that this bike thing will really, actually be a new habit." created="Tue, 07 Aug 2007 18:22:41 GMT"/>		<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.odannyboy.com/blog/new_archives/2007/06/the_feed_reader.html&quot;&gt;Dan Saffer&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/z2007-07-01-SafferRssSocialNetwork&quot;&gt;via Bill Seitz&lt;/a&gt;): &quot;With many people trying to figure out how to stitch our social networks (and thus our online identities) together, it occurs to me that we already have such a thing, although no feed reader that I know of is really up to the task yet.&quot;" created="Tue, 07 Aug 2007 21:55:22 GMT"/>		<outline text="This is actually something I've been thinking about and taking baby swipes at.  Feed polling and aggregation - but with a specialized UI - is the way to go for distributed social network messaging that can be enabled pretty much web-wide.  For more immediacy, the ultimate layer could be &lt;a href=&quot;http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/twitter-is-jabber&quot;&gt;XMPP-based&lt;/a&gt; at some point.  Taking a layered approach could fold in a huge number of existing services, while allowing gradual enhancement where more capable nodes can interact with each other." created="Tue, 07 Aug 2007 21:56:19 GMT"/>		<outline text="Further thinking:  A web-based layer between feed polling and Jabber/XMPP could be mutual private &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/atompub-charter.html&quot;&gt;atompub&lt;/a&gt;.  Alice and Bob make contact (somehow) - this entails trading bespoke APP drop-box URLs and some auth details or secrets.  Alice can use the URL and auth details to POST messages to Bob, and vice versa." created="Tue, 07 Aug 2007 22:00:13 GMT"/>		<outline text="In more detail: Say that Alice authenticates at Bob's site with her OpenID URL.  Maybe she wants to comment on a blog entry that Bob's published.  As part of the validation process, Bob's site asks permission to contact Alice in the future.  Along with asking permission, Bob's site extends a private APP drop-box URL - thereby pre-emptively offering Alice reciprocal permission to contact Bob in the future." created="Tue, 07 Aug 2007 23:20:51 GMT"/>		<outline text="If Alice agrees to be contacted in the future, her OpenID provider includes an APP drop-box for Alice's in the OpenID validation return trip.  This process is similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://openid.net/specs/openid-simple-registration-extension-1_0.html&quot;&gt;OpenID Simple Registration Extension&lt;/a&gt;.  Or, Alice's provider could use Bob's APP drop-box right away by POSTing details of an APP drop-box for Alice.  Thus, in either case, Alice and Bob can talk in the future by POSTing Atom entries at each other via the exchanged drop-boxes.  Not quite Jabber / XMPP, but more immediate than feed polling." created="Wed, 08 Aug 2007 00:25:49 GMT"/>		<outline text="There could be spam potential here for Bob, but Bob's site could throw away the APP drop-box it offered and any messages recieved through it if Alice never validates her identity or never agrees to be contacted.  Conversely, Alice can cut Bob off at the drop-box at any point.  Private APP drop-boxes that can be thrown away are essential to this." created="Wed, 08 Aug 2007 00:13:24 GMT"/>		<outline text="The above, of course, assumes a mutual connection.  Following someone could still be done with feed polling.  But, for one-way private subscription, the process flips - Alice's OpenID provider extends an APP drop-box upon validation to allow Bob's site to send her newsletters.  Alice can't send responses to Bob unless he POSTs a reciprocal drop-box, but maybe that's fine for this use case.  Spam could be controlled in this channel by cutting off the private APP drop-box Alice extended to Bob's site." created="Tue, 07 Aug 2007 23:53:42 GMT"/>		<outline text="Now, consider Jabber / XMPP servers as gateways to the above system of APP drop-box exchange not entirely unlike the IM bot run by Twitter.  Web-based archival and optional publishing of messages, but with desktop notification and message transmission." created="Wed, 08 Aug 2007 00:33:31 GMT"/>		</body>	</opml>
