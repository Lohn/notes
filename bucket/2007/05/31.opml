Instead of cute icons and pleasant surprises, you could send rusty nails and moldy hams.

Now I'll find it so much harder to squash impulse buys of music due to DRM lockdown.  I haven't bought a thing from iTunes since about 6 months after the store opened, thanks to that.  But now...  Oh, I'm in trouble now." created="Thu, 31 May 2007 20:40:27 GMT"/>		<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://markbernstein.org/May0701/Getyourselfaserver.html&quot;&gt;Mark Bernstein&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Continuing with the spring cleaning theme: you need a server.

As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/05/30/googleGears.html&quot;&gt;Dave Winer mentions&lt;/a&gt;, it's not totally new - though renewed interest / uptake might do odd and wonderful things with the concept now.  Personally, I've been interested in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/2001/01/04/desktopWebsites.html#4&quot;&gt;desktop websites&lt;/a&gt; since before the days of &lt;a href=&quot;http://radio.userland.com&quot;&gt;Radio UserLand 8&lt;/a&gt; and around the time of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/davenet/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe.html&quot;&gt;Fractional Horsepower HTTP Servers&lt;/a&gt;." created="Thu, 31 May 2007 15:09:45 GMT"/>		<outline text="And, of course, &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/apis/gears/&quot;&gt;Google Gears&lt;/a&gt; has piqued my interest as well.  Poking around with offline web apps has been on my round tuit list since &lt;a href=&quot;http://codinginparadise.org/&quot;&gt;Brad Neuberg&lt;/a&gt; first clued me in about his &lt;a href=&quot;http://dojotoolkit.org/offline&quot;&gt;Dojo Offline Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; in the works.  Seems like there's something brewing here, and I'll probably wish I had lots of offline apps when I'm on the plane to the UK next month." created="Thu, 31 May 2007 15:02:17 GMT"/>		<outline text="My ears definitely perked up when I read that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mikechambers.com/blog/2007/05/30/apollo-beta-will-include-sqlite-embedded-database/&quot;&gt;Apollo will include SQLite&lt;/a&gt;.  Maybe I'll finally build a Flash-based news aggregator &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/06/19/flash-agg&quot;&gt;like I've thought about for years&lt;/a&gt;.  You know, for me, every new platform gets interesting when I can conceivably build a news aggregator with it.  :)  Kind of a mutant cousin to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/Z/Zawinskis-Law.html&quot;&gt;Zawinski's Law&lt;/a&gt;." created="Thu, 31 May 2007 14:57:34 GMT"/>		<outline text="Also, thinking more favorable thoughts &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2007/05/25#When:11:02:29AM&quot;&gt;than last week&lt;/a&gt; about the new Facebook platform.  Having a great amount of social network fatigue, I find it hard to get enthused about yet another one at all - popularity notwithstanding.  But, having done my own &quot;hello world&quot; app, perused the docs, and poked around the edges - I have to say that this looks like a promising way to add self-hosted guest rooms onto their walled garden.  And without weird and barely tolerated hacks, ala MySpace.  It's the reverse of inside-out mashups via public APIs - &lt;a href=&quot;http://developers.facebook.com/documentation.php&quot;&gt;but they've got those too&lt;/a&gt;.  It's not necessarily either-or.  If your audience includes people who (unlike me) are living on / through Facebook, this is a good way to loop your app more easily into their routine." created="Thu, 31 May 2007 14:47:15 GMT"/>		<outline text="Not sure what to think about &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.last.fm/2007/05/30/lastfm-acquired-by-cbs&quot;&gt;CBS buying last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.
