Hack Day in London&lt;/a&gt; on June 16th &amp; 17th to offer some &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us&quot;&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; representation.  Thanks to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/18/just-call-me-crash&quot;&gt;klutzy bus exit last September&lt;/a&gt;, I missed the Hack Day in Sunnyvale with Beck - hopefully a trip to the UK will ameliorate my regret in missing that event.

It's a light day - I'll have skimmed through these and more before bed.

And that's because no one's talking to him.  Really, this should be a FAQ for all social media, to be read by all journalists and commentators:  Listening in on random strangers' conversations is more likely to be boring than not, and that's what you're doing if you just go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com&quot;&gt;twitter.com&lt;/a&gt; and start clicking around.  But, to assume because &lt;i&gt;you're&lt;/i&gt; bored that the service as a &lt;i&gt;whole&lt;/i&gt; is boring is, again, to be one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noogenesis.com/pineapple/blind_men_elephant.html&quot;&gt;Blind Men with an Elephant&lt;/a&gt;." created="Wed, 16 May 2007 18:17:01 GMT"/>			<outline text="Twitter becomes immensely interesting when it turns out that you've amassed a group of contacts who tend to run in similar circles as you, because even their off-handed remarks and random burps have a decent chance of surfacing something interesting or entertaining.  When it's good, this sets up a nice ambient chatter like sitting in a coffee shop filled with just your kind of people." created="Wed, 16 May 2007 18:24:23 GMT"/>			<outline text="This same &quot;I'm bored, so it's boring&quot; mistake has popped up again and again - applied to blogging, MMORPGs, social bookmarking, MySpace, what have you.  Replace &quot;bored/boring&quot; with &quot;confused/confusing&quot; or &quot;annoyed/annoying&quot; and you've got my own early reactions to MySpace." created="Wed, 16 May 2007 18:25:00 GMT"/>			<outline text="But, really, it's not &lt;i&gt;addressed to you&lt;/i&gt; if there's a buzz and you're not groking it.  That's a clue that you're probably missing something.  Granted, people can be insane, but it really is more likely that you're missing something - even if it's just that there's a particular brand of entertaining insanity in progress to which you're not attuned." created="Wed, 16 May 2007 18:28:06 GMT"/>			</outline>		<outline text="I love that on &lt;a href=&quot;http://planetretcon.com/index.php?p=SGC&quot;&gt;The Stargate Café&lt;/a&gt;, a sci-fi sitcom podcast, they use &quot;pod&quot; and &quot;blog&quot; as profanity-substitutes for &quot;god&quot; and &quot;damn&quot;.
