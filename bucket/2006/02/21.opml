I could channel all my daily bookmarking habits into an install of Scuttle on the server in my basement and CC: all the other places where I have bookmarking accounts - thereby remaining in possession of my data whilst still participating in the other services.

The dev machine goes into a 100% CPU consumption death spiral.  Unfortunately, the updater code is 90% voodoo to me and entirely unrelated to how code gets updated elsewhere in the OPML Editor, so at this moment all I do is shrug and go to bed." created="Tue, 21 Feb 2006 05:23:00 GMT"/>		</body>	</opml>
