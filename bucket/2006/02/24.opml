If XSLT were built into the OPML Editor, other formats could be as close as a Save As.  Of course, UserTalk scripts to save in other formats are possible as well - but XSLT can live a life outside the Editor, say, on PHP-powered servers." created="Sat, 25 Feb 2006 04:40:10 GMT"/>				<outline text="I wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/XSLScraper&quot;&gt;XSLT-based RSS/Atom feed scraper&lt;/a&gt; that I think would make a good companion to the NewsRiver tool, if it could run on the same platform." created="Sat, 25 Feb 2006 04:41:37 GMT"/>				</outline>			<outline text="I suppose, as a mockup, I could start stubbing out some XSLT scripts that use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/05/xslt&quot;&gt;the W3C XSLT servlet&lt;/a&gt; or a PHP script on my server to perform the transformations until an updated DLL is available." created="Sat, 25 Feb 2006 04:51:32 GMT"/>			</outline>		<outline text="I know I've initiated a slew of potential projects since I began playing with the OPML Editor, though I won't be able to do much in depth for a little while.  I'm mostly queueing up work for myself after I finish this book, and hoping that a few of these leads get stolen by others with more time on their hands.  &quot;;-&gt;&quot;  Think of it as public brainstorming or doodles." created="Sat, 25 Feb 2006 04:34:29 GMT"/>		<outline text="Although, I do worry sometimes that there might be a few people out there who think I'm going off some manic deep end with all this sudden blogging activity.  But really, this is the sort of thing that runs through my head a lot of the time, but it tends to evaporate or disappear onto post-its I lose shortly thereafter.  It's like quantum mental foam, might amount to vacuum nothing or it might collapse into something material.  I don't think that metaphor's quite right - but anyway, it's just been too easy to spew notions into published outline nodes, so I've been going with it.  In the meantime, I hope my enthusiasm is entertaining at least." created="Sat, 25 Feb 2006 05:05:49 GMT"/>		<outline text="That said, here's another notion:  I wonder how the OPML Editor could be used to help facilitate &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.structuredblogging.org/formats.php&quot;&gt;Structured Blogging&lt;/a&gt;?" created="Sat, 25 Feb 2006 04:36:55 GMT"/>		<outline text="Here's something I just stumbled upon:  I've seen some people wondering just what gets updated after getting the latest code for the OPML Editor.  Well, if you jump to &lt;code&gt;user.rootUpdates.prefs&lt;/code&gt; and set &lt;code&gt;flShowUpdatesToUser&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, you'll start seeing granular update reports.  I don't think this breaks anything, but I haven't dug deep enough to be sure.  Also, the messages are a bit cryptic if you're not familiar with the ODB structure.  So, as usual, know that Here Be Dragons." created="Sat, 25 Feb 2006 04:21:14 GMT"/>		<outline text="There's a scene in Stargate Atlantis tonight, where there's a busboy clearing a table in the canteen.
