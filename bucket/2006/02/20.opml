Praxis comprises a cycle of action-reflection-action which is central to liberatory education. Characteristics of praxis include self-determination (as opposed to coercion), intentionality (as opposed to reaction), creativity (as opposed to homogeneity), and rationality (as opposed to chance).&quot;  (See also: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.last.fm/music/Consolidated/_/Praxis&quot;&gt;&quot;Praxis&quot; by Consolidated&lt;/a&gt;, which is what got me googling for the term.)" created="Mon, 20 Feb 2006 22:36:35 GMT"/>		<outline text="I've got today off from work, but that doesn't mean I'm not working.  I'm hoping to get a dozen or so pages ahead on the current chapter, maybe even get this one done early.
