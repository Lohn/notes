Does anyone have an RDF-based outline format for me to use?

And, apropos my recent enthusiasm for the OPML Editor platform, it's just come back to me:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontier.userland.com/tcpIm&quot;&gt;Frontier and Radio UserLand have support for instant messaging via AIM and Jabber&lt;/a&gt;.  I wonder how up-to-date that support is in the OPML Editor?

Speaking as &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2006/02/14#When:3:17:36PM&quot;&gt;an avowed neophile&lt;/a&gt;, who knows if this will be a permanent change, but it's looking pretty interesting so far." created="Thu, 16 Feb 2006 15:39:15 GMT"/>			<outline text="I'm wondering if I'll miss the more advanced visualization tools in Tinderbox.  I never quite got into the export features, beyond converting my notes into XOXO and OPML.  And, I always stopped short of truly &quot;living&quot; within the powerful agents and structured data facilities of Tinderbox.  I'm not sure if it was a reluctance to develop a dependency on something not Open Source, or what.  Tinderbox is nonetheless a powerful and rich tool." created="Thu, 16 Feb 2006 15:43:40 GMT"/>			<outline text="And as for Ecto, it has wonderful features for managing existing entries and has a great preview window - but I can publish to my OPML blog so fast that I never need preview, and I if I actually need to manage existing entries I can either edit the OPML or go to my WordPress administration screens." created="Thu, 16 Feb 2006 15:46:15 GMT"/>			<outline text="I also realize that I never quite &quot;lived&quot; in Radio UserLand, back when I was heavily using it.  I never did much with outlines in it, mostly using it as a news aggregator and a quirky hacking environment.  Not that the same parts are cobbled together as an idea management and publishing system called OPML Editor, the perspective changes a bit for me." created="Thu, 16 Feb 2006 16:21:45 GMT"/>			</outline>		<outline text="The OPML Editor is Open Source" created="Thu, 16 Feb 2006 15:30:11 GMT">			<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/2006/02/16.html#When:9:27:52AM&quot;&gt;Dave says&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;I'm starting to get a new release of the OPML Editor together, as part of the release I asked Andre Radke to prepare a download for the kernel source. The OPML Editor is an open source app, licensed under the GPL.&quot;" created="Thu, 16 Feb 2006 12:34:00 GMT"/>			<outline text="I can certainly &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2006/02/13#When:7:59:00PM&quot;&gt;attest to the fact that the OPML Editor is Open Source&lt;/a&gt;, and not vapor or a mirage of any kind.  In fact, I'm writing this on version 10.1a6 that I compiled myself with Apple's Xcode from a SourceForge CVS check-out.  It's a serious effort to have made it this easy.  I didn't have to tweak or coax anything - I just clicked on the Build hammer." created="Thu, 16 Feb 2006 15:23:48 GMT"/>			<outline text=" And, to expand on what I said earlier this week:  The OPML Editor and &lt;a href=&quot;http://frontierkernel.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Frontier Kernel&lt;/a&gt; is an Open Source release of a project with a decade or more of legacy as a commercial product - yet, it still compiles into a useful application and runs without much fuss.  That was the big thing that Mozilla missed when it was first released as Open Source.  This is exciting stuff and a hard thing to have accomplished, me thinks." created="Thu, 16 Feb 2006 15:26:14 GMT"/>			</outline>		<outline text="A few years ago, maybe back around 1998, I lost my college class ring at a KMFDM/PIG concert in Detroit.  I was sweaty, there were bodies slamming around, I was pushing bodies away from me, and after one push my ring was gone.  Crap.  Yesterday, though, I received the ring in a package.  Someone had found it after the concert back then and was finally able to find me online to tell me about it.  How's that for cool?" created="Thu, 16 Feb 2006 05:02:47 GMT"/>		</body>	</opml>
