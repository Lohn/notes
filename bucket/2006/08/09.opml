I'd heard of it, looked briefly at &lt;a href=&quot;http://codesorcery.net/pukka&quot;&gt;the site&lt;/a&gt;, but decided it was of no use to me.  Instead, my old standby is a personally tweaked version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://ejohn.org/blog/super-fast-delicious-bookmarklet/&quot;&gt;John Resig's Superfast Bookmarklet&lt;/a&gt; in Firefox.  But then, I watched &lt;a href=&quot;http://codesorcery.net/screencast&quot;&gt;the screencast&lt;/a&gt;.  There's nothing like a good screencast to shed some light on an app's special sauce.  So I downloaded &lt;a href=&quot;http://codesorcery.net/pukka&quot;&gt;Pukka&lt;/a&gt;, tried it, and am actually now considering the $5 registration fee in exchange for my free bookmarklet.

And, since I left off the daily OPML Editor habit for blogging, I've not been blogging much at all.  Maybe it's time to pick it up again." created="Thu, 10 Aug 2006 02:16:06 GMT"/>		</body>	</opml>
