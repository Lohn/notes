There's one for both &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrysler.com/autoshow/archives.html&quot;&gt;Chrysler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chrysler.com/autoshow/archives.html&quot;&gt;Jeep&lt;/a&gt;, too.  This is how I spent my Chrismas vacation.  What you don't see is the behind-firewall private intranet application used by an editorial team to aggregate and republish news items in the listed feeds." created="Thu, 16 Mar 2006 03:21:58 GMT"/>		<outline text="Alas, the above reading lists don't work with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grazr.com/&quot;&gt;Grazr&lt;/a&gt;.  Curse these relative URLs - they sure made development on testing and QA servers easier, though." created="Thu, 16 Mar 2006 03:30:56 GMT"/>		<outline text="Something's broken in my NewsRiver.  I'm not sure what yet, because I haven't had time to dig through and figure it out.  Scheduled feed scans don't work, or perhaps don't finish.  Something bombs out or hangs in the middle.  Lately, I've been kicking it over by hand, and sometimes that takes a few tries to get it through my whole list.  I think I saw a feed list order shuffler in the code somewhere, which might account for the random behavior - maybe there's a certain feed in there that wedges things?  But, there've been no error messages that I've seen.  Mighty frustrating.  Hopefully I'll get the chance to see what's what." created="Wed, 15 Mar 2006 11:46:11 GMT"/>		<outline text="Hey, look:  It's Wednesday.  Is it weird that one of the thing I look forward to most these days is that Wednesday means bagels in the kitchen at work?
