I really love absorbing the details and mechanics of the writing and creation process at work.

There's always so much to do, see, read and think.  I used to stay up until 2:00 AM every night, despite always getting up around 6:30 AM for work the next day.  When I &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/blog/2003/07/23/sleep_apnea&quot;&gt;descended into sleep apnea and finally got treatment&lt;/a&gt;, however, sleep became a sacred thing to me after having been denied it for too long.  So, now I go to bed much, much earlier.  Seems like earlier and earlier, these days.  Nonetheless, I still can't easily get myself to take mid-day naps.  When I finally sleep, it feels like I'm giving up on the day.  Yeah, I'm weird." created="Mon, 27 Mar 2006 11:55:16 GMT"/>		<outline text="Another morning, still alive.  I came home from work last night, bumped into things at home for an hour or two, then crashed way early and slept for 9 hours.  I think I needed that." created="Mon, 27 Mar 2006 11:54:09 GMT"/>		</body>	</opml>
