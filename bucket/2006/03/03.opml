In OPML 2.0 you can add data to outlines in namespaces.

Because, in fact, thanks to namespaces I could see dropping any microformat data (ie. hReview, hCard, hCalendar) into an OPML outline node." created="Fri, 03 Mar 2006 14:35:47 GMT"/>			<outline text="I was thinking of these microformats as &quot;core&quot; to XOXO because they're being developed by the same people along the same principles, but there's nothing in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://microformats.org/wiki/xoxo&quot;&gt;XOXO spec&lt;/a&gt; itself which loops in other microformats directly.  So, they're not literally any more &quot;core&quot; to XOXO than they are to OPML." created="Fri, 03 Mar 2006 14:37:07 GMT"/>			<outline text="Of course, there's the spirit of the thing - mixing OPML and XHTML microformats might seem like a gross hack to some, kind of like mixing RSS and Atom elements in the same feed.  But, it's possible, it's parseable, and it might just be useful." created="Fri, 03 Mar 2006 14:40:15 GMT"/>			</outline>		<outline text="The comment system here is a bit flakey and easy to get out of sync when I revise the page and someone happens to see an older entry via RSS.

I'm running the OPML Editor on my work PC, which is how I'm writing this now.  But, I had to copy down today's outline to this computer manually.  If I recall (shoddily, since my notes are on the laptop), there's &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/trac/browser/trunk/OpmlServer/RPC2.php&quot;&gt;a getFilesChangedSince() method of the OPML Community Server API&lt;/a&gt; - I wonder if I could throw together a tool at some point to keep all my OPML Editor instances in sync?" created="Fri, 03 Mar 2006 14:25:20 GMT"/>		<outline text="During the course of working on these two books, I've learned that I can program while listening to people talking - ie. fiction or discussion podcasts.  But, once I start actually spewing words myself, I have to switch over to music.

It's got decent predictive text entry that tends not to annoy me overly much, so I'm pretty quick at tapping things out.  I always come back to email eventually, later, when things are calm - so this is like IM-ing myself, one-way into the future.  (Too bad I can't respond!)   Although it looks like it's down now, I can actually see a conceptual use for Dave's old &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mailtothefuture.com/&quot;&gt;Mail to the Future&lt;/a&gt; service.  Sometimes it's just so handy to defer a thought into the future, yet getting it out of your overloaded head." created="Fri, 03 Mar 2006 11:53:59 GMT"/>		<outline text="Am I the only one who's disturbed by the Sherwin-WIlliams logo and &quot;Cover the Earth&quot; slogan?  Actually, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/29894&quot;&gt;it does&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.velociworld.com/Velociblog/Oldvelocity/001271.html&quot;&gt;look like&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=%22cover+the+earth%22+%22sherwin-williams%22&quot;&gt;I have some company&lt;/a&gt;.  I see this logo on delivery trucks from time to time, and it just kind of hits me with a shock.  Like... Cover the Earth?  Did they mean &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=%22pave+the+earth%22&quot;&gt;Pave the Earth&lt;/a&gt;?  Is that paint?  Or is that blood?  Or maybe world domination?  It reminds me of that TV series revival of &quot;War of the Worlds,&quot; where upon coming back from commercial breaks they'd depict a giant three-fingered hand creeping over the top of the Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://hosting.opml.org/decafbad/gems/SWP.jpg&quot; /&gt;" created="Fri, 03 Mar 2006 11:41:52 GMT"/>		<outline text="TGIF, and thank goodness we have coffee again - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starbucks.com/ourcoffees/product.asp?category_name=Africa%2FArabia&amp;product_id=SAN&amp;cookie%5Ftest=1&quot;&gt;Arabian Mocha Sanani from Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;.
