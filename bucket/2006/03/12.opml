Other days, all I want to do is veg.  This is closer to the latter sort of days.  This is one of the reasons I love idea-catcher tools that have low friction like the OPML Editor:  I can buffer up the ideas from heavy flow days, and still have things to work on on light flow days.  Hmm.  Maybe I should rethink that phrasing on a day when my brain's working better." created="Mon, 13 Mar 2006 01:53:31 GMT"/>		<outline text="There are two main things I've gotten from blogging in OPML, lately:  One is just how natural and easy it is to manage an entire day of blogging in a single outline.  The other is the value of hanging out in a closer-knit blogging community smaller than the whole blogosphere." created="Sun, 12 Mar 2006 20:59:13 GMT"/>		<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://gluft.wordpress.com/2006/03/11/quit-smoking/&quot;&gt;George chimes in with his quit smoking story.&lt;/a&gt;" created="Sun, 12 Mar 2006 18:00:58 GMT"/>		<outline text="Linking to bookmarks on del.icio.us" created="Sun, 12 Mar 2006 17:23:32 GMT">			<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.opml.org/thisislisa/2006/03/12#anAsideAboutDelicious&quot;&gt;Lisa wonders about linking to a bookmark on del.icio.us.&lt;/a&gt;  Here's how you do it:" created="Sun, 12 Mar 2006 17:22:13 GMT"/>			<outline text="&lt;code&gt;http://del.icio.us/url?url=http://www.decafbad.com&lt;/code&gt;" created="Sun, 12 Mar 2006 17:23:45 GMT"/>			<outline text="Simply replace my blog's URL with your desired URL, and you're off.

This is easily handled in scripts - but for doing it by hand, 90% of the time simply tacking the URL on the end as a parameter works.
