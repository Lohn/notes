And you know what?  There's nothing so complex about this thing that couldn't be cloned in a weekend or two in PHP.  I wonder how hard it would be to clone in the OPML Community Server?  I could see a bit of a race between the Atom Publishing Protocol and S3 to see which gets adopted faster as the &lt;i&gt;Way to Publish Files Over the Web&lt;/i&gt;.  The OPML Community Server API is pretty keen too, though no one's seriously proposed it as anything other than the &lt;i&gt;Way the OPML Editor Docks with a Mothership&lt;/i&gt;." created="Tue, 28 Mar 2006 16:56:04 GMT"/>		<outline text="Good morning.
