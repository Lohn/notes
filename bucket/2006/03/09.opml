I've been mentally cataloguing the various grouse-points raised by OPML critics over the past few years, and I think it'll be important when the spec is frozen to produce a POV which answers each of these points with the ways in which OPML 2 fixes them - or obviates the &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; for a fix.  Because after reading and letting the spec sink in, I really think that OPML 2 is a major upgrade in terms of nailing things down and tightening things up - and I suspect that a lot of people aren't expecting that and have already dismissed OPML 2." created="Thu, 09 Mar 2006 14:48:07 GMT"/>		<outline text="Morning.
