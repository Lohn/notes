I've got a dozen or so reading lists subscribed, totalling around 700 feeds.  This isn't an indictment of newsRiver itself, more like I'm really giving it a regular stress test and there's probably just &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; thing somewhere in its guts that's going awry for some weird corner case.
