I think finding ways to make that happen more reliably on command is one of the significant skills I need to pick up as I work on actually being a pro at this.  Because, when it works, I can really get in a zone - but when it doesn't, I can really get stuck." created="Wed, 08 Mar 2006 04:33:30 GMT"/>		<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.opml.org/amyloo/2006/03/07#cowskull&quot;&gt;Amy&lt;/a&gt;, I've often wondered about the cowskull myself.  I seem to remember knowing more about it at one time, but it's since slipped from my head.  It's got something about the cactus mojo in Frontier.  And, &lt;a href=&quot;http://static.userland.com/userLandDiscussArchive/msg022177.html&quot;&gt;Dave says&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;&lt;i&gt;You won't often see a cowskull sulking.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;" created="Wed, 08 Mar 2006 01:54:20 GMT"/>		<outline text="&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.scripting.com/mail/images/frontierAnimated.gif&quot; /&gt;" created="Wed, 08 Mar 2006 02:00:49 GMT"/>		<outline text="I've not done more than just barely view source on Ray Ozzie's &lt;a href=&quot;http://spaces.msn.com/editorial/rayozzie/demo/liveclip/liveclipsample/clipboardexample.html&quot;&gt;web clipboard demo&lt;/a&gt;, but it has a really good smell about it.  Use microformats, seems like magic, works between browsers by way of my actual system clipboard on OS X.  I really need to look into this some more." created="Wed, 08 Mar 2006 00:12:24 GMT"/>		<outline text="Er, what?!  There's a such thing as onCopy and onPaste JavaScript events for HTML form fields?  Get outta here!  Hmm, seems &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOM_Events#Microsoft-specific_events&quot;&gt;Microsoft-specific&lt;/a&gt;... and also &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/SafariJSProgTopics/Tasks/CopyAndPaste.html&quot;&gt;in Safari&lt;/a&gt;... and the demo worked for me on Firefox.  I wonder if this is just like AJAX - something Microsoft came up with that everyone else implemented because it was a good idea despite not being W3C-spec?  The plot thickens - for me, anyway." created="Wed, 08 Mar 2006 00:20:06 GMT"/>		<outline text="Another hint about the web clipboard thing:  In Firefox, try selecting View &gt; Page Style &gt; No Style.  You can see more of the guts of the thing." created="Wed, 08 Mar 2006 00:28:38 GMT"/>		<outline text="And, what, no RSS feed for &lt;a href=&quot;http://discuss.microsoft.com/SCRIPTS/WA-MSD.EXE?A0=LIVE-CLIP&quot;&gt;the LIVE-CLIP mailing list&lt;/a&gt;?

I think I need to quiet down for a bit and let some other people talk." created="Tue, 07 Mar 2006 23:23:12 GMT"/>			<outline text="My verbosity stems from a personal desire to see this particular issue moved toward a resolution - hopefully my motor mouth helped provide a few points of clarity.  This crosses one of my favorite apps (&lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/opml2-review/message/145&quot;&gt;Tinderbox&lt;/a&gt;) with what I think is one of the persistent grouse-points of OPML (&lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/opml2-review/message/155&quot;&gt;large amounts of text with line breaks in XML attributes&lt;/a&gt;)." created="Tue, 07 Mar 2006 23:42:24 GMT"/>			<outline text="Personally, I think that the attributes issue is a non-issue, but it's one that needs a definitive FAQ answer at which to point.  Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/opml2-review/message/89&quot;&gt;the RFC822 vs ISO8601 date format thing&lt;/a&gt; - there are people who'll never be gut-happy with it, but I don't think it presents any real technical limitations.  There are &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; more interesting things to work on, once this one is put to bed." created="Tue, 07 Mar 2006 23:42:36 GMT"/>			</outline>		<outline text="Yup.  Coffee, and a cat.
