The author / narrator expresses such a great deal of appreciation for his listeners, it makes me want to run over there and give him a standing ovation.  Even if I am the only guy doing it.

This is because most of the feeds I read all follow the Title-Link-Description style of blogging.  But, now that I'm getting into this rapid-fire brain dump OPML blogging, many of the entries from the more recent additions to my reading lists are all completely without titles.  And now my aggregator looks weird." created="Wed, 01 Mar 2006 14:55:06 GMT"/>		<outline text="You know, now that I've applied &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.opml.org/2005/09/24#a280&quot;&gt;that outline icon fix&lt;/a&gt;, and I see what I was missing, I realize why I was confused from time to time with what was happening in my various lists and subscription sets.
