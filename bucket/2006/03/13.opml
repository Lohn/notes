So, what if the XML namespace URI was also the value used for the &quot;type&quot; attribute on nodes?  I could see all sorts of wrangling going on coming up with registries and conventions for values of the &quot;type&quot; attribute, but URI are good unique identifiers.  So, why not make them serve for both the namespace &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the node type?" created="Mon, 13 Mar 2006 18:33:05 GMT"/>		<outline text="Good morning, all.
