In fact, some grousers might begrudge that RSS and OPML have succeeded &lt;i&gt;despite&lt;/i&gt; his strong personality and loud pronouncements." created="Sun, 19 Mar 2006 03:05:32 GMT"/>			<outline text="This isn't a cult of personality.  These technologies have been adopted and further evangelized by people who've &lt;i&gt;won something&lt;/i&gt; from their use.  Other technologies - with what I've heretofore seen as well-articulated superiorities - have not yet seen such adoption, and require continued effort to grow.  To simply assert that RSS and OPML &lt;i&gt;suck&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware&quot;&gt;are shitty&lt;/a&gt; - as if that's convincingly self-evident - is to miss the lesson embedded in the fact that people go right on using &lt;a href=&quot;http://davenet.scripting.com/1995/09/03/wemakeshittysoftware&quot;&gt;shitty technology&lt;/a&gt; anyway." created="Sun, 19 Mar 2006 03:22:44 GMT"/>			<outline text="One could conclude that all these people are stupid, clueless, and/or just plain misguided.  But in reality, odds are that at least a few of them are pretty smart and have good reasons for what they're doing - dismissing them dooms one to miss the plank stuck in the eye of one's own favorite technology.  Meanwhile, calling someone stupid and insulting their choices wrecks goodwill for the alternatives." created="Sun, 19 Mar 2006 03:25:15 GMT"/>			<outline text="This is why I've been trying to take a fresh look and immersing myself in OPML and Winerian technology:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/01/07/beginners-mind-versus-teachers-mind&quot;&gt;This is me, in my Beginner's Mind stance.&lt;/a&gt;  I honestly want to learn / re-learn the reasons for the apparent lacking success of that which I've perceived as technically superior.  If possible, I'd like to build some bridges, both technical and personal.  There are no &quot;sides&quot; for me to take, other than striving to be in a position to help encourage progress on all sides of building a more expressive web." created="Sun, 19 Mar 2006 03:31:33 GMT"/>			</outline>		<outline text="Hey, where'd that surge of brain power come from?" created="Sun, 19 Mar 2006 03:50:53 GMT"/>		<outline text="Interesting discussion between &lt;a href=&quot;http://platformwars.blogspot.com/2006/03/tools-and-semweb-synweb-debate.html&quot;&gt;Phil Jones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://dannyayers.com/2006/03/18/pleas-please-me&quot;&gt;Danny Ayers&lt;/a&gt; on their respective blogs, very much along the lines of how &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/02/13/reading-lists-opml-xoxo-semantic-web-and-tools&quot;&gt;I've been lately thinking about tools and formats&lt;/a&gt;.  There's more I want to say - but due to my current state of low brain power, I'm just asserting the connections for now." created="Sun, 19 Mar 2006 02:44:47 GMT"/>		<outline text="Ever notice that most of the same people who have a grouse with OPML and RSS have a hard time with PHP, too?  (This includes me, historically.)  All successful technologies, all a bit dirty.  I have a hunch about why this is so, but I've not yet had spare brain cycles to articulate it.  But, just think: Why don't we have a Xanadu web run on Lisp serving up perfect, crystalline RDF?" created="Sun, 19 Mar 2006 02:39:15 GMT"/>		<outline text="I've started the process to sign up for an author profile and blog at Amazon.

This should be interesting." created="Sun, 19 Mar 2006 01:23:13 GMT"/>		<outline text="Evening - I'm at home, and have just finished a second burrito.  Have I mentioned that I've developed a belief in burritos as the perfect crunch-time food?" created="Sun, 19 Mar 2006 01:22:00 GMT"/>		<outline text="Afternoon - I'm at work, and there's no bagels.
