The last time I really bothered to play the social self-disclosure game was for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://deus-x.livejournal.com/profile&quot;&gt;LiveJournal profile&lt;/a&gt;, about 6 years ago.  I've done it with varying degrees of enthusiasm in other venues, but anymore I'm just tired of self-describing for social networking sites.  This is where FOAF starts looking good to me:  I just want to point each new profile - like my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com/in/lmorchard&quot;&gt;weak LinkedIn profile&lt;/a&gt;, for example - at a master resource and autofill.  Of course, it doesn't help that visiting MySpace makes me throw up in my mouth a little, every time." created="Wed, 19 Apr 2006 02:14:00 GMT"/>		<outline text="Also:  I'm considering a new MacBook Pro in the next year or so, and I'd like to take better care of it than I have this 40-month-old 867Mhz G4 PowerBook 12&quot;.  We have cats, so one of the nastiest things is that there's a micro-hairball woven under each keyboard scissor.  Does anyone have any experience with those silicone keyboard protectors?  Annoying?  Worth it?  Removal of the cats is not an option." created="Tue, 18 Apr 2006 19:41:18 GMT"/>		<outline text="Ugh.  My poor little PowerBook has a few loose teeth on its keyboard.  Heavy use of various keys - as well as a botched attempt at cleaning awhile back - have left a few of the &quot;scissor&quot; mechanisms a bit injured.  I swapped some of these around to less important keys, but I'm debating ordering new parts.  And that's not to mention the half-dozen or so keys whose paint my fingers are wearing through.  Good thing I remember where A and S are." created="Tue, 18 Apr 2006 19:37:20 GMT"/>		<outline text="One tough thing about taking screenshots for a book:  You've got to keep your asses and asshats out of the picture.  Bastards aren't considered welcome, either." created="Tue, 18 Apr 2006 15:07:57 GMT"/>		<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2006/04/14/mochikit-at-the-ajax-experience/&quot;&gt;In cases like these&lt;/a&gt;, I wish I could send a webcam-equipped Roomba to a conference in my stead." created="Tue, 18 Apr 2006 10:40:18 GMT"/>		</body>	</opml>
