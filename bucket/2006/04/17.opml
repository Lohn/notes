I took &lt;a href=&quot;http://hosting.opml.org/decafbad/library-camp-20060414.opml&quot;&gt;lots of notes in OPML&lt;/a&gt; (also &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/blog/library-camp-2006/&quot;&gt;rendered in HTML&lt;/a&gt;), tried to &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/tags/librarycamp/&quot;&gt;take lots of pictures&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://del.icio.us/tag/librarycamp&quot;&gt;posted lots of bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;.  The event went by in a flash, and the unconference format seemed to go very well.  We went from a blank schedule to &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.library2.net/index.php/FinalSchedule&quot;&gt;a full dance card&lt;/a&gt; in about an hour, and there was plenty to do and discuss." created="Mon, 17 Apr 2006 15:49:28 GMT"/>			<outline text="I'm a techie and an admirer of librarians - so, I went hoping I could contribute some info and knowledge with regard to things like RSS and social software and anything else I might have to offer.  I've been following the sorts of things &lt;a href=&quot;http://superpatron.com/&quot;&gt;Edward Vielmetti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blyberg.net&quot;&gt;John Blyberg&lt;/a&gt; - so this seemed like a good venue to go meet &amp; greet &amp; catch up with things.  I hope I was able to contribute something useful." created="Mon, 17 Apr 2006 15:58:39 GMT"/>			<outline text="I feel like I probably mentioned my books too many times.  Although I am overjoyed about being able to self-identify as an Author of Books, I wasn't trying to brag or sell any copies.  It was more like I was intimidated by all the librarians doing and discussing cool stuff.  I had a bit of social-phobia triggered and I think I was trying to justify why I was there - especially since I hadn't really known what an OPAC or an ILS was for, until a few weeks ago.  &quot;;-&gt;&quot;  But, I figure if anyone's really annoyed with me, they can let me know." created="Mon, 17 Apr 2006 16:03:26 GMT"/>			<outline text="I'm trying to decide if I have the time to better edit / present my notes from LibraryCamp.  They're in pretty raw form right now, but they might be useful to someone.  I think I missed some significant things here or there in amidst my posting and editing.  I hope to get in touch with people I met there to see what they're up to - I just hope I remember names with faces!  A few new Flickr and del.icio.us contacts help with that, though." created="Mon, 17 Apr 2006 16:09:39 GMT"/>			<outline text="At any rate, if anyone who met me at LibraryCamp wants to get a hold of me or has any questions or needs any help - I'm at your disposal!" created="Mon, 17 Apr 2006 16:17:40 GMT"/>			</outline>		<outline text="Hello world!" created="Mon, 17 Apr 2006 14:30:03 GMT"/>		</body>	</opml>
