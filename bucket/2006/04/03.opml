The &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?categoryID=47&amp;externalID=128&quot;&gt;authentication scheme for S3&lt;/a&gt; requires SHA1.  JavaScript-based apps can be served up from the S3 domain as files stored via S3.  All of this adds up to JavaScript apps hosted on S3 with AJAX-based read/write access to S3 itself." created="Mon, 03 Apr 2006 19:26:56 GMT"/>		<outline text="New favorite band: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thereverseengineers.com/&quot;&gt;The Reverse Engineers&lt;/a&gt;.
