The second one, &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/10/25/ipod-go-thud-then-click-click-click&quot;&gt;I got back in October when I dropped the first one on a marble floor&lt;/a&gt;.  But, last night, it died when it took a header out of my pocket and bounced off the parking lot pavement.  Last time I used a mailer and sent it back to Apple for replacement - but this time, I just drove straight to the Apple store.  The Genius Bar denizen took one look at it, held it to his ear, and said &quot;I'll be right back.&quot;  A few minutes later, he returned from the back room and handed me my third iPod.  It's syncing podcasts now and reloading music from my home server.  I've got to say: I don't think I'll ever get an Apple product sans-AppleCare.  I'm probably very tunnel-visioned at this point, but I can't imagine getting this sort of service from another gadget company.  Over the past few years I've gotten a few replacement hard drives, a new keyboard and assorted keys, and now two new iPods - all covered by AppleCare.  I'd say the cost has been covered." created="Thu, 20 Apr 2006 22:25:39 GMT"/>		</body>	</opml>
