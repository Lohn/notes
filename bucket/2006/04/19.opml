The weather's been getting nicer and I've been wearing wrist braces constantly, all to good effect.  The book is in production now, and I've been fielding small questions and making very small tweaks.  Work's been a bit slow, too.  I've been playing with ideas for our wedding - we're writing our own vows and being picky about music.  Beyond that, I've been carefully avoiding doing anything extra for a little while.  So, that means things have been a bit quiet around here.  No worries - I'm sure that after I've gotten my fill of being restful, I'll have another burst of activity and hacking around here." created="Wed, 19 Apr 2006 21:34:39 GMT"/>		</body>	</opml>
