And, imagine if that RSS feed listed those new files as BitTorrent enclosures, with a few item elements fed from metadata headers (ie. title, description, etc).

Everyone in our team installs one GM script, and after that we can all deploy new GM code to each others' browsers on the fly.  It's very, very evil and exploitable code - but we all trust each other so far, and the code's totally available for view from Subversion.  I could probably sneak something in to steal everyone's MySpace passwords, but that wouldn't last long." created="Tue, 04 Apr 2006 20:14:28 GMT"/>		<outline text="So last night, I started making good on the implied threat contained in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2006/04/03#When:3:26:56PM&quot;&gt;yesterday's idle musings about Amazon S3&lt;/a&gt;.  I've started building &lt;a href=&quot;http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/S3Ajax&quot;&gt;S3Ajax, an AJAX-based wrapper for Amazon's S3&lt;/a&gt;.  Between S3, the OPML Community Server API, and what will hopefully come out of the Atom Publishing Protocol - I think web-based filesystem APIs have the potential to be a Next Big Thing." created="Tue, 04 Apr 2006 15:19:02 GMT"/>		<outline text="Good morning everyone.  Trying another morning with naked wrists, hoping to maintain a modicum of posture so as not to become too dependant yet on braces.  Also:  Co-worker brought in some damn tasty coffee that somehow made it through the office Bunn intact." created="Tue, 04 Apr 2006 15:16:33 GMT"/>		</body>	</opml>
