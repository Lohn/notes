// bucket for 2009-02-23

* And, since this was an active day on the bucket, I'm starting to
think that maybe I should try to switch feeds to producing an item per
bullet point rather than this one big blob-per-day.

* So, inspired by [Dave's re-release of the 2005-era OPML Editor
blogging tool][blogtool], I've made [some tweaks][tweaks] to the
bucket here that has made it possible to import all my old [OPML blog
entries][opmlblog] just by copying the files into the proper data
directory.

    * One of my next steps, once I have time for another hacking
    sprint is to implement an [OPML Community Server API][oapi]
    endpoint here that will allow me to use the [OPML Editor][oe] to
    [upstream][upstream] entries to this bucket.

    * So, thus far, this bucket supports entries as single files per
    day or a directory of files per dayâ€”and in Markdown, Textile, 
    HTML, and OPML formats.

    * And, soon, I might have both `git push` and an XML-RPC API as
    means of publishing to this bucket.  Kind of insane, but these
    things match a workflow I want to support.

* A big difference between this and my old [OPML Blog][opmlblog] is that
the OPML Editor tracks the datestamp of when an outline item is first
created.  That makes it so easy to come up with permalinks granular to
the item.  Trying to figure out how to do that here.

    * Of course, I may eventually just go back to the OPML Editor.

    * What might be interesting is to slap an [OPML Community Server
    API][oapi] in front of this bucket.

* I'm trying to get a `post-receive` hook in git to auto-update the
remote site, but without much luck yet.

    * One more try, using [this tip][3].

    * HUGE SUCCESS!

* The new (for me) big idea about this thing is that now I'm
"publishing" entries with this thing using `git push`.  I've got a
`master` branch without any content, and a `prod`
branch that holds all my entries.  The `master` branch gets pushed to
[github][1], and the `prod` branch gets pushed to [decafbad.com][2]

* Oh yeah, and I'm trying out Disqus instead of Haloscan for comments
for the the first time.

* I've also got both PHP and JS versions of Markdown and Textile on
hand, so at some point I'd like to introduce some web-based editing
with live previews that can also be synched back down to my laptop via
`git pull`.

* I suppose this thing is sort of like a Twitter account, but with
hopefully more context.  I'd like to use this for the dumping of
thoughts too long for Twitter, yet too short for what I think of as a
proper blog entry on decafbad.com.
