* I wonder if either Markdown or Textile would make a good format with
which to author a book?

    * I was thinking maybe Textile, with a few additional formatting
    conventions.

    * If I ever did any self-publishing work, I'd want to avoid MS Word
    like the plague.

    * I can write all my own formatting and processing code myself,
    probably even generate PDFs.  Could use git to manage the work
    too.
