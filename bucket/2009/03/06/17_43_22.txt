* You know, the early versions of Mac OS X were like that [swamp castle
scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail][castle]:

     >"Listen, lad. I built this kingdom up from nothing. When I
     started here, all there was was swamp. Other kings said I was
     daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same,
     just to show 'em. 
     
     >It sank into the swamp. 
     
     >So, I built a second one. 
     
     >That sank into the swamp. 
     
     >So, I built a third one. 
     
     >That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp,
     but the fourth one... stayed up! And that's what you're gonna
     get, lad: the strongest castle in these islands."
